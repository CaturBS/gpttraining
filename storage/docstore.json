A N D  \nSINGLE-HANDED    I    CAN  \nMOVE    THE    WORLD\"  \n \n \n \n \nFrom a very early age, we are taught to break apart problems, to fragment the world. \nThis apparently makes complex tasks and subjects more manageable, but we pay a \nhidden, enormous price. We can no longer see the consequences of our actions; we lose \nour intrinsic sense of connection to a larger whole. When we then try to \"see the big \npicture,\" we try to reassemble the fragments in our minds, to list and organize all the \npieces. But, as physicist David Bohm says, the task is futile\u2014similar to trying to \nreassemble the fragments of a broken mirror to see a true reflection. Thus, after a while \nwe give up trying to see the whole altogether. \nThe tools and ideas presented in this book are for destroying the illusion that the \nworld is created of separate, unrelated for ces. When we give up this illusion\u2014we can \nthen build \"learning organizations,\" organizations where people continually expand \ntheir capacity to create the results they truly desire, where new and expansive patterns \nof thinking are nurtured, where collective aspiration is set free, and where people are \ncontinually learning how to learn together. \nAs Fortune  magazine recently said, \"Forget your tired old ideas about leadership. The \nmost successful corporation of the 19 90s will be something called a learning \norganization.\" \"The ability to learn faster than your competitors,\" said Arie De Geus, \nhead of planning for Royal Dutch/Shell, \"may be the only sustainable competitive \nadvantage.\" As the world becomes more interconnected and business becomes more \ncomplex and dynamic, work must become more \"learningful.\" It is no longer sufficient \nto have one person learning for the organization, a Ford or a Sloan or a Watson. It's \njust not possible any longer to \"figure it out\" from the top, and have everyone else \nfollowing the orders of the \"grand strategist.\" The organizations that will truly excel in \nthe future will be the organizations that di scover how to tap pe ople's commitment and \ncapacity to learn at all levels in an organization. \nLearning organizations are possible because, deep down, we are all learners. No one \nhas to teach an infant to learn. In fact, no one has to teach infants anything. They are \nintrinsically inquisitive, masterful learners who learn to walk, speak, and pretty much \nrun their households all on their own. Learning organizations are possible because not \nonly is it our nature to learn but we love to learn. Most of us at one time or another \nhave been part of a great \"team,\" a group of people who functioned together in an \nextraordinary way\u2014 who trusted one another, who complemented each others' \nstrengths and compensated for each others' limitations, who had common goals that \nwere larger than individual goals, and who produced extraordinary results. I have met \nmany people who have experienced this sort of profound teamwork\u2014in sports, or in \nthe performing arts, or in business. Many say that they have spent much of their life \nlooking for that experience again.

Whereas once many industries were \ndominated by a single, undisputed leader \u2014one IBM, one Kodak, one Procter & \nGamble, one Xerox\u2014today industries, especially in manufacturing, have dozens of \nexcellent companies. American and European corporations are pulled forward by the \nexample of the Japanese; the Japanese, in turn, are pulled by the Koreans and \nEuropeans. Dramatic improvements take place in corporations in Italy, Australia, \nSingapore\u2014and quickly become influential around the world. \nThere is also another, in some ways deeper, movement toward learning organizations, \npart of the evolution of industrial society. Material affluence for the majority has \ngradually shifted people's orientation toward work\u2014from what Daniel Yankelovich \ncalled an \"instrumental\" view of work, where work was a means to an end, to a more \n\"sacred\" view, where people seek the \"intrinsic\" benefits of work.1 \"Our grandfathers \nworked six days a week to earn what most of us now earn by Tuesday afternoon,\" says \nBill O'Brien, CEO of Hanover Insurance. \"The ferment in management will continue \nuntil we build organizations that are more consistent with man's higher aspirations \nbeyond food, shelter and belonging.\" \nMoreover, many who share these values ar e now in leadership positions. I find a \ngrowing number of organizational leaders who, while still a minority, feel they are part \nof a profound evolution in the nature of work as a social institution. \"Why can't we do \ngood works at work?\" asked Edward Simon, president of Herman Miller, recently. \n\"Business is the only institution that has a ch ance, as far as I can see, to fundamentally \nimprove the injustice that exists in the worl d. But first, we will have to move through \nthe barriers that are keeping us from being truly vision-led and capable of learning.\" \nPerhaps the most salient reason for building learning organizations is that we are only \nnow starting to understand the capabilities such organizations must possess. For a long \ntime, efforts to build learning organizations were like groping in the dark until the \nskills, areas of knowledge, an d paths for development of such organizations became \nknown. What fundamentally will distinguish learning organization s from traditional \nauthoritarian \"controlling organizations\" will be the mastery of certain basic disciplines. \nThat is why the \"disciplines of the learning organization\" are vital. \nDISCIPLINES  OF THE LEARNING  ORGANIZATION \nOn a cold, clear morning in December 19 03, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, the \nfragile aircraft of Wilbur and Orville Wright proved that powered flight was possible. \nThus was the airplane invented; but it would take more than thirty years before \ncommercial aviation could serve the general public. \nEngineers say that a new idea has been \"invented\" when it is proven to work in the \nlaboratory. The idea becomes an \"innovation\" only when it can be replicated reliably on \na meaningful scale at practical costs. If the idea is sufficiently im portant, such as the \ntelephone, the digital computer, or commercial aircraft, it is called a \"basic innovation,\" \nand it creates a new industry or transforms an existing industry. In these terms, learning \norganizations have been invented, but they have not yet been innovated. \nIn engineering, when an idea moves from an invention to an innovation, diverse \n\"component technologies\" come together. Emerging from isolated developments in \nseparate fields of research, these components gradually form an \"ensemble of \ntechnologies that are critical to each others' success. Until this ensemble forms, the \nidea, though possible in the laboratory, does not achieve its potential in practice.2 \nThe Wright Brothers proved that powered flight was possible, but the McDonnell \nDouglas DC-3, introduced in 1935, ushered in the era of commercial air travel. The \nDC-3 was the first plane that supported itse lf economically as well as aerodynamically. \nDuring those intervening thirty years (a typical time period for incubating basic", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4287, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3146dd42-69dd-4079-a0ef-e4d58533f8ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "3146dd42-69dd-4079-a0ef-e4d58533f8ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

Like early \nexperiments with learning organizations, the early planes were not reliable and cost \neffective on an appropriate scale. \nThe DC-3, for the first time, brought together five critical component technologies \nthat formed a successful ensemble. They were : the variable-pitch propeller, retractable \nlanding gear, a type of lightweight molded body construction called \"monocque,\" radial \nair-cooled engine, and wing flaps. To succeed , the DC-3 needed all five; four were not \nenough. One year earlier, the Boeing 247 was introduced with all of them except wing \nflaps. Lacking wing flaps, Bo eing's engineers found that the plane was unstable on take-\noff and landing and had to downsize the engine. \nToday, I believe, five new \"component technologies\" are gradually converging to \ninnovate learning organizations. Though developed separately, each will, I believe, \nprove critical to the others' success, just as  occurs with any ensemble. Each provides a \nvital dimension in building organizations that can truly \"learn,\" that can continually \nenhance their capacity to realize their highest aspirations: \nSystems Thinking.  A cloud masses, the sky darkens, leaves twist upward, and we \nknow that it will rain. We also know that  after the storm, the runoff will feed into \ngroundwater miles away, and the sky will grow clear by tomorrow. All these events are \ndistant in time and space, and yet they are all connected within the same pattern. Each \nhas an influence on the rest, an influence that is usually hidden from view. You can \nonly understand the system of a rainstorm by contemplating the whole, not any \nindividual part of the pattern. \nBusiness and other human endeavors are also systems. They, too, are bound by \ninvisible fabrics of interrelated actions, which often take years to fully play out their \neffects on each other. Since we are part of that lacework ourselves, it's doubly hard to \nsee the whole pattern of change. Instead, we tend to focus on snapshots of isolated \nparts of the system, and wonder why our deepest problems never seem to get solved. \nSystems thinking is a conceptual framework, a body of knowledge and tools that has \nbeen developed over the past fifty years, to make the full patterns clearer, and to help \nus see how to change them effectively. \nThough the tools are new, the underlying worldview is extremely intuitive; \nexperiments with young children show that they learn systems thinking very quickly. \nPersonal Mastery.  Mastery might suggest gaining dominance over people or things. \nBut mastery can also mean a special level of  proficiency. A master craftsman doesn't \ndominate pottery or weaving. People with a high level of personal mastery are able to \nconsistently realize the results that matter most deeply to them\u2014 in effect, they \napproach their life as an artist would approach a work of art. They do that by becoming \ncommitted to their own lifelong learning. \nPersonal mastery is the discipline of c ontinually clarifying and deepening our \npersonal vision, of focusing our energies, of developing patience, and of seeing reality \nobjectively. As such, it is an essential cornerstone of the learning organization\u2014the \nlearning organization's spiritual foundation. An organization's commitment to and \ncapacity for learning can be no greater than that of its members. The roots of this \ndiscipline lie in both Eastern and Western spir itual traditions, and in secular traditions \nas well. \nBut surprisingly few organizations encourage the growth of their people in this \nmanner. This results in vast untapped resources: \"People enter business as bright, well-\neducated, high-energy people, full of energy and desire to make a difference,\" says \nHanover's O'Brien. \"By the time they are 30, a few are on the \"fast track\" and the rest \n'put in their time' to do what matters to them on the weekend. They lose the \ncommitment, the sense of mission, and the excitement with which they started their \ncareers. We get damn little of their energy and almost none of their spirit.\" \nAnd surprisingly few adults work to rigorously develop their own personal mastery. \nWhen you ask most adults what they want from their lives, they often talk first about", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4313, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d184008b-3c92-4c5e-b280-2d4806a28692": {"__data__": {"id_": "d184008b-3c92-4c5e-b280-2d4806a28692", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

Very often, we are not consciously aware of our mental models or the \neffects they have on our behavior. For example, we may notice that a co-worker dresses \nelegantly, and say to ourselves, \"She's a country club person.\" About someone who \ndresses shabbily, we may feel, \"He doesn't care about what others think.\" Mental \nmodels of what can or cannot be done in different management settings are no less \ndeeply entrenched. Many insights into new markets or outmoded organizational \npractices fail to get put into practice because they conflict with powerful, tacit mental \nmodels. \nRoyal Dutch/Shell, one of the first large organizations to understand the advantages \nof accelerating organizational learning came to this realization when they discovered \nhow pervasive was the influence of hidden mental models, especially those that become \nwidely shared. Shell's extraordinary success in managing through the dramatic changes \nand unpredictability of the world oil busine ss in the 1970s and 1980s came in large \nmeasure from learning how to surface and challenge manager's mental models. (In the \nearly 1970s Shell was the weakest of the big seven oil companies; by the late 1980s it \nwas the strongest.) Arie de Geus, Shell's recently retired Coordinator of Group \nPlanning, says that continuous adaptation and growth in a changing business \nenvironment depends on \"institutional learning, which is the process whereby \nmanagement teams change their shared mental models of the company, their markets, \nand their competitors. For this reason, we think of planning as learning and of \ncorporate planning as institutional learning.\"3 \nThe discipline of working with mental models starts with turning the mirror inward; \nlearning to unearth our internal pictures of the world, to bring them to the surface and \nhold them rigorously to scrutiny. It also includes the ability to carry on \"learningful\" \nconversations that balance inquiry and advocacy, where people expose their own \nthinking effectively and make that thinking open to the influence of others. \nBuilding Shared Vision.  If any one idea about leadership has inspired organizations \nfor thousands of years, it's th e capacity to hold a shared picture of the future we seek to \ncreate. One is hard pressed to think of any organization that has sustained some \nmeasure of greatness in the absence of goals, values, and missions that become deeply \nshared throughout the organization. IBM had \"service\"; Polaroid had instant \nphotography; Ford had public transportation for the masses and Apple had computing \npower for the masses. Though radically different in content and kind, all these \norganizations managed to bind people together around a common identity and sense of \ndestiny. \nWhen there is a genuine vision (as opp osed to the all-too-familiar \"vision \nstatement\"), people excel and learn, not becaus e they are told to, but because they want \nto. But many leaders have personal visions that never get translated into shared visions \nthat galvanize an organization. All too often, a company's shared vision has revolved \naround the charisma of a leader, or around a crisis that galvanizes everyone temporarily. \nBut, given a choice, most people opt for pursuing a lofty goal, not only in times of \ncrisis but at all times. What has been lackin g is a discipline for translating individual \nvision into shared vision\u2014not a \"cookbook\" but a set of principles and guiding \npractices.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4201, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "95f283f7-d292-4555-8f4d-4c89cc37f86e": {"__data__": {"id_": "95f283f7-d292-4555-8f4d-4c89cc37f86e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

In \nmastering this discipline, leaders learn the co unterproductiveness of trying to dictate a \nvision, no matter how heartfelt. \nTeam Learning.  How can a team of committed managers with individual IQs above \n120 have a collective IQ of 63? The discipline of team learning confronts this paradox. \nWe know that teams can learn; in sports, in the performing arts, in science, and even, \noccasionally, in business, there are striking examples where the inte lligence of the team \nexceeds the intelligence of the individuals in the team, and where teams develop \nextraordinary capacities for coordinated action. When teams are truly learning, not only \nare they producing extraordinary results but the individual members are growing more \nrapidly than could have occurred otherwise. \nThe discipline of team learning starts with \"dialogue,\" the capacity of members of a \nteam to suspend assumptions and enter into a genuine \"thinking together.\" To the \nGreeks dia-logos  meant a free-flowing of meaning through a group, allowing the group \nto discover insights not attainable individually. Interestingly, the practice of dialogue \nhas been preserved in many \"primitive\" cultures, such as that of the American Indian, \nbut it has been almost completely lost to modern society. Today, the principles and \npractices of dialogue are being rediscovered and put into a contemporary context. \n(Dialogue differs from the more common \"discussion,\" which has its roots with \n\"percussion\" and \"concussion,\" literally a heaving of ideas back and forth in a winner-\ntakes-all competition.) \nThe discipline of dialogue also involves learning how to recognize the patterns of \ninteraction in teams that undermine learning. The patterns of defensiveness are often \ndeeply engrained in how a team operates. If unrecognized, they undermine learning. If \nrecognized and surfaced creatively, they can actually accelerate learning. \nTeam learning is vital because teams, not individuals, are the fundamental learning \nunit in modern organizations. This where \"the rubber meets the road\"; unless teams \ncan learn, the organization cannot learn. \nIf a learning organization were an engineering innovation, such as the airplane or the \npersonal computer, the components would be called \"technologies.\" For an innovation \nin human behavior, the components need to be seen as disciplines. By \"discipline,\" I do \nnot mean an \"enforced order\" or \"means of punishment,\" but a body of theory and \ntechnique that must be studied and mastered to be put into practice. A discipline is a \ndevelopmental path for acquiring certain skills  or competencies. As with any discipline, \nfrom playing the piano to electrical engineering, some people have an innate \"gift,\" but \nanyone can develop proficiency through practice. \nTo practice a discipline is to be a lifelong learner. You \"never arrive\"; you spend your \nlife mastering disciplines. You can never say, \"We are a learning organization,\" any \nmore than you can say, \"I am an enlightened person.\" The more you learn, the more \nacutely aware you become of your ignorance. Thus, a corporation cannot be \"excellent\" \nin the sense of having arrived at a permanen t excellence; it is always in the state of \npracticing the disciplines of learning, of becoming better or worse. \nThat organizations can benefit from disciplines is not a totally new idea. After all, \nmanagement disciplines such as accounting have been around for a long time. But the \nfive learning disciplines differ from more familiar management disciplines in that they \nare \"personal\" disciplines. Each has to do wi th how we think, what we truly want, and \nhow we interact and learn with one another. In this sense, they are more like artistic \ndisciplines than traditional management discip lines. Moreover, while accounting is good \nfor \"keeping score,\" we have never approached the subtler tasks of building \norganizations, of enhancing their capabilities for innovation and creativity, of crafting \nstrategy and designing policy and structur e through assimilating new disciplines. \nPerhaps this is why, all too often, great organizations are fleeting, enjoying their \nmoment in the sun, then passing quietly back to the ranks of the mediocre.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4421, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a0f5b25-7bdd-42dd-807a-f7b1ac13a3a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a0f5b25-7bdd-42dd-807a-f7b1ac13a3a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

While interesting, I believe such descriptions can often do more harm \nthan good, leading to piecemeal copying and playing catch-up. I do not believe great \norganizations have ever been built by trying to emulate another, any more than \nindividual greatness is achieved by trying to copy another \"great person.\" \nWhen the five component technologies conv erged to create the DC-3 the commercial \nairline industry began. But the DC-3 was not the end of the process. Rather, it was the \nprecursor of a new industry. Similarly, as the five component learning disciplines \nconverge they will not create the learning  organization but rather a new wave of \nexperimentation and advancement. \nTHE FIFTH DISCIPLINE \nIt is vital that the five disciplines develop as an ensemble. This is challenging because \nit is much harder to integrate new tools than simply apply them separately. But the \npayoffs are immense. \nThis is why systems thinking is the fifth disc ipline. It is the discipline that integrates \nthe disciplines, fusing them into a coherent body of theory and practice. It keeps them \nfrom being separate gimmicks or the latest organization change fads. Without a \nsystemic orientation, there is no motivation to look at how the disciplines interrelate. \nBy enhancing each of the other disciplines, it continually reminds us that the whole can \nexceed the sum of its parts. \nFor example, vision without systems thinking ends up painting lovely pictures of the \nfuture with no deep understanding of the forces that must be mastered to move from \nhere to there. This is one of the reasons why many firms that have jumped on the \n\"vision bandwagon\" in recent years have found that lofty vision alone fails to turn \naround a firm's fortunes. Without systems thinking, the seed of vision falls on harsh \nsoil. If nonsystemic thinking predominates, the first condition for nurturing vision is \nnot met: a genuine belief that we can make our vision real in the future. We may say \n\"We can achieve our vision\" (most American ma nagers are conditioned to this belief), \nbut our tacit view of current reality as a set of conditions created by somebody else \nbetrays us. \nBut systems thinking also needs the discip lines of building shared vision, mental \nmodels, team learning, and personal mastery to realize its potential. Building shared \nvision fosters a commitment to the long te rm. Mental models focus on the openness \nneeded to unearth shortcomings in our present ways of seeing the world. Team learning \ndevelops the skills of groups of people to look for the larger picture that lies beyond \nindividual perspectives. And personal mastery fosters the personal motivation to \ncontinually learn how our actions affect our world. Without personal mastery, people \nare so steeped in the reactive mindset (\"someone/something else is creating my \nproblems\") that they are deeply thre atened by the systems perspective. \nLastly, systems thinking makes understandable the subtlest aspect of the learning \norganization\u2014the new way individuals perceive themselves and their world. At the \nheart of a learning organization is a shift of mind\u2014from seeing ourselves as separate \nfrom the world to connected to the world, from seeing problems as caused by someone \nor something \"out there\" to seeing how our own actions create the problems we \nexperience. A learning organization is a pl ace where people are continually discovering \nhow they create their reality. And how th ey can change it. As Archimedes has said, \n\"Give me a lever long enough . . . and single-handed I can move the world.\" \nMETANOIA\u2014A   SHIFT   OF   MIND \nWhen you ask people about what it is like being part of a great team, what is most \nstriking is the meaningfulness of the experience.

Some spend the rest of their lives looking for \nways to recapture that spirit. \nThe most accurate word in Western culture to describe what happens in a learning \norganization is one that hasn't had much currency for the past several hundred years. It \nis a word we have used in our work with organizations for some ten years, but we always \ncaution them, and ourselves, to use it sparingly in public. The word is \"metanoia\" and it means a \nshift of mind. The word has a rich history. For the Greeks, it meant a fundamental shift or \nchange, or more literally transcendence (\"meta\" \u2014above or beyond, as in \"metaphysics\") of mind \n(\"noia,\" from the root \"nous,\" of mind). In the early (Gnostic) Christian tradition, it took on a \nspecial meaning of awakening shared intuition and direct knowing of the highest, of God. \n\"Metanoia\" was probably the key term of such early Christians as John the Baptist. In the \nCatholic corpus the word metanoia wa s eventually translated as \"repent.\" \nTo grasp the meaning of \"metanoia\" is to grasp the deeper meaning of \"learning,\" for learning \nalso involves a fundamental shift or movement of mind. The problem with talking about \n\"learning organizations\" is that the \"learning\" ha s lost its central meaning in contemporary usage. \nMost people's eyes glaze over if you talk to them about \"learning\" or \"learning organizations.\" \nLittle wonder\u2014for, in everyday use, learning has come to be synonymous with \"taking in \ninformation.\" \"Yes, I learned all about that at the course yesterday.\" Yet, taking in information \nis only distantly related to real learning. It would be nonsensical to say, \"I just read a great book \nabout bicycle riding\u2014I've now learned that.\" \nReal learning gets to the heart of what it means to be human. Through learning we \nre-create ourselves. Through learning we become able to do something we never were \nable to do. Through learning we reperceive the world and our relationship to it. \nThrough learning we extend our capacity to create, to be part of the generative process \nof life. There is within each of us a deep hu nger for this type of learning. It is, as Bill \nO'Brien of Hanover Insurance says, \"as fundamental to human beings as the sex drive.\" \nThis, then, is the basic meaning of a \"learning organization\"\u2014an organization that is \ncontinually expanding its capacity to create its future. For such an organization, it is not \nenough merely to survive. \"Survival learning\" or what is more often termed \"adaptive \nlearning\" is important\u2014indeed it is nece ssary. But for a learning organization, \n\"adaptive learning\" must be joined by \"generative learning,\" learning that enhances our \ncapacity to create. \nA few brave organizational pioneers are pointing the way, but the territory of \nbuilding learning organizations is still largely unexplored. It is my fondest hope that this \nbook can accelerate that exploration. \nPUTTING THE IDEAS INTO PRACTICE  \nI take no credit for inventing the five ma jor disciplines of this book. The five \ndisciplines described below represent the experimentation, research, writing, and \ninvention of hundreds of people. But I have worked with all of the disciplines for years, \nrefining ideas about them, collaborating on research, and introducing them to \norganizations throughout the world. \nWhen I entered graduate school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in \n1970, I was already convinced that most of the problems faced by humankind \nconcerned our inability to grasp and manage the increasingly complex systems of our \nworld. Little has happened since to chan ge my view. Today, the arms race, the \nenvironmental crisis, the international drug trade, the stagnation in the Third World, \nand the persisting U.S. budget and trade deficits all attest to a world where problems \nare becoming increasingly complex and in terconnected. From the start at MIT I was \ndrawn to the work of Jay Forrester, a co mputer pioneer who had shifted fields to \ndevelop what he called \"system dynamics.\" Jay maintained that the causes of many \npressing public issues, from urban decay to global ecological threat, lay in the very well-\nintentioned policies designed to alleviate th em. These problems were \"actually systems\"", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4388, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90f75649-3481-4f30-9af0-d1554fecd1c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "90f75649-3481-4f30-9af0-d1554fecd1c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

I felt that \nthe solutions to the Big Issues lay in the public sector. But I began to meet business \nleaders who came to visit our MIT group to learn about systems thinking. These were \nthoughtful people, deeply aware of the inad equacies of prevailing ways of managing. \nThey were engaged in building new types of organizations \u2014decentralized, \nnonhierarchical organizations dedicated to the well-being and growth of employees as \nwell as to success. Some had crafted ra dical corporate philosophies based on core \nvalues of freedom and responsibility. Others had developed innovative organization \ndesigns. All shared a commitment and a capacity to innovate that was lacking in the \npublic sector. Gradually, I came to realize why business is the locus of innovation in an \nopen society. Despite whatever hold past thinking may have on the business mind, \nbusiness has a freedom to experiment missing in the public sector and, often, in \nnonprofit organizations. It also has a clear \"bottom line,\" so that experiments can be \nevaluated, at least in principle, by objective criteria. \nBy why were they interested in systems thinking? Too often, the most daring \norganizational experiments were foundering. Local autonomy produced business \ndecisions that were disastrous for the organization as a whole. \"Team building\" \nexercises sent colleagues white-water raftin g together, but when they returned home \nthey still disagreed fundamentally about business problems. Companies pulled together \nduring crises, and then lost all their inspiration when business improved. Organizations \nwhich started out as booming successes, with the best possible intentions toward \ncustomers and employees, found themselves trapped in downward spirals that got \nworse the harder they tried to fix them. \nThen, we all believed that the tools of systems thinking could make a difference in \nthese companies. As I worked with differe nt companies, I came to see why systems \nthinking was not enough by itself. It needed a new type of management practitioner to \nreally make the most of it. At that time, in the mid-1970s, there was a nascent sense of \nwhat such a management practitioner could be. But it had not yet crystallized. It is \ncrystallizing now with leaders of our MIT group: William O'Brien of Hanover \nInsurance; Edward Simon from Herman Miller, and Ray Stata, CEO of Analog \nDevices. All three of these men are involved  in innovative, influential companies. All \nthree have been involved in our research program for several years, along with leaders \nfrom Apple, Ford, Polaroid, Royal Dutch/ Shell, and Trammell Crow. \nFor eleven years I have also been involved in developing and conducting Innovation \nAssociates' Leadership and Mastery workshops , which have introduced people from all \nwalks of life to the fifth discipline ideas that have grown out of our work at MIT, \ncombined with IA's path-breaking work on building shared vision and personal \nmastery. Over four thousand managers have attended.

In 1983, a Royal \nDutch/Shell survey found that one third of the firms in the Fortune \"500\" in 1970 had \nvanished.1 Shell estimated that the average lif etime of the largest industrial enterprises \nis less than forty years, roughly half the lifetime of a human being! The chances are \nfifty-fifty that readers of this book will se e their present firm disappear during their \nworking career. \nIn most companies that fail, there is abunda nt evidence in advance that the firm is in \ntrouble. This evidence goes unheeded, however, even when individual managers are \naware of it. The organization as a whole cannot recognize impending threats, \nunderstand the implications of those threats, or come up with alternatives. \nPerhaps under the laws of \"survival of the fittest,\" this continual death of firms is \nfine for society. Painful though it may be for the employees and owners, it is simply a \nturnover of the economic soil, redistributing the resources of production to new \ncompanies and new cultures. But what if the high corporate mortality rate is only a \nsymptom of deeper problems that afflict all companies, not just the ones that die? What \nif even the most successful companies are poor learners\u2014they survive but never live up \nto their potential? What if, in light of what organizations could be, \"excellence\" is \nactually \"mediocrity\"? \nIt is no accident that most organizations learn poorly. The way they are designed and \nmanaged, the way people's jobs are defined, and, most importantly, the way we have all \nbeen taught to think and interact (not only in organizations but more broadly) create \nfundamental learning disabilities. These disabilities operate despite the best efforts of \nbright, committed people. Often the harder they try to solve problems, the worse the \nresults. What learning does occur takes pl ace despite these learning disabilities\u2014for \nthey pervade all organizations to some degree. \nLearning disabilities are tragic in children, especially when they go undetected. They \nare no less tragic in organizations, where they also go largely undetected. The first step \nin curing them is to begin to identify the seven learning disabilities: \n1. \"I AM MY POSITION\" \nWe are trained to be loyal to our jobs\u2014so much so that we confuse them with our \nown identities. When a large American steel company began closing plants in the early \n1980s, it offered to train the displaced steelworkers for new jobs.

Most see \nthemselves within a \"system\" over which they have little or no influence. They \"do \ntheir job,\" put in their time, and try to cope with the forces outside of their control. \nConsequently, they tend to see their responsibilities as limited to the boundaries of \ntheir position. \nRecently, managers from a Detroit auto maker told me of stripping down a Japanese \nimport to understand why the Japanese were able to achieve extraordinary precision \nand reliability at lower cost on a particular assembly process. They found the same \nstandard type of bolt used three times on the engine block. Each time it mounted a \ndifferent type of component. On the American car, the same assembly required three \ndifferent bolts, which required three different wrenches and three different inventories \nof bolts\u2014making the car much slower and more costly to assemble. Why did the \nAmericans use three separate bolts? Because the design organization in Detroit had \nthree groups of engineers, each responsible for \"their component only.\" The Japanese \nhad one designer responsible for the entire engine mounting, and probably much more. \nThe irony is that each of the three groups of American engineers considered their work \nsuccessful because their bolt and assembly worked just fine. \nWhen people in organizations focus only on their position, they have little sense of \nresponsibility for the results produced wh en all positions interact. Moreover, when \nresults are disappointing, it can be very diffi cult to know why. All you can do is assume \nthat \"someone screwed up.\" \n2. \"THE ENEMY IS OUT THERE\" \nA friend once told the story of a boy he coached in Little League, who after dropping \nthree fly balls in right field, threw down his glove and marched into the dugout. \"No \none can catch a ball in that darn field,\" he said. \nThere is in each of us a propensity to find someone or something outside ourselves \nto blame when things go wrong. Some organizations elevate this propensity to a \ncommandment: \"Thou shall always find an external agent to blame.\" Marketing blames \nmanufacturing: \"The reason we keep missin g sales targets is that our quality is not \ncompetitive.\" Manufacturing blames engineer ing. Engineering blames marketing: \"If \nthey'd only quit screwing up our designs and let us design the products we are capable \nof, we'd be an industry leader.\" \nThe \"enemy is out there\" syndrome is actually a by-product of \"I am my position,\" \nand the nonsystemic ways of lo oking at the world that it fo sters. When we focus only \non our position, we do not see how our own actions extend beyond the boundary of \nthat position. When those actions have consequences that come back to hurt us, we \nmisperceive these new problems as externally  caused. Like the person being chased by \nhis own shadow, we cannot seem to shake them. \nThe \"Enemy Is Out There\" syndrome is no t limited to assigning blame within the \norganization. During its last years of operation, the once highly successful People \nExpress Airlines slashed prices, boosted marketing, and bought Frontier Airlines\u2014all \nin a frantic attempt to fight back against the perceived cause of its demise: increasingly \naggressive competitors. Yet, none of thes e moves arrested the company's mounting \nlosses or corrected its core problem, service quality that had declined so far that low \nfares were its only remaining pull on customers. \nFor many American companies, \"the enemy\" has become Japanese competition, labor \nunions, government regulators, or customers who \"betrayed us\" by buying products \nfrom someone else. \"The enemy is out there, \" however, is almost always an incomplete \nstory. \"Out there\" and \"in here\" are usually part of a single system.

THE ILLUSION OF TAKING CHARGE \nBeing \"proactive\" is in vogue. Managers frequently proclaim the need for taking \ncharge in facing difficult problems. What is typically meant by this is that we should \nface up to difficult issues, stop waiting fo r someone else to do something, and solve \nproblems before they grow into crises. In pa rticular, being proactive is frequently seen \nas an antidote to being \"reactive\"\u2014waiting until a situation gets out of hand before \ntaking a step. But is taking aggressive action against an external enemy really \nsynonymous with being proactive? \nNot too long ago, a management team in a leading property and liability insurance \ncompany with whom we were working got bitt en by the proactivene ss bug. The head of \nthe team, a talented vice president for claims, was about to give a speech proclaiming \nthat the company wasn't going to get push ed around anymore by lawyers litigating \nmore and more claims settlements. The firm would beef up its own legal staff so that it \ncould take more cases through to trial by verdict, instead of settling them out of court. \nThen we and some members of the team began to look more sys-temically at the \nprobable effects of the idea: the likely fraction of cases that might be won in court, the \nlikely size of cases lost, the monthly direct and overhead costs regardless of who won \nor lost, and how long cases would probably stay in litigation. (The tool we used is \ndiscussed in Chapter 17, \"Microworlds.\") Inte restingly, the team's scenarios pointed to \nincreasing total costs because, given the quali ty of investigation done initially on most \nclaims, the firm simply could not win enough of its cases to offset the costs of \nincreased litigation. The vice president tore up his speech. \nAll too often, \"proactiveness\" is reactiveness in disguise. If we simply become more \naggressive fighting the \"enemy out there,\" we are reacting\u2014regardless of what we call \nit. True proactiveness comes from seeing how we contribute to our own problems. It is \na product of our way of thinking, not our emotional state. \n4. THE FIXATION ON EVENTS \nTwo children get into a scrap on the playground and you come over to untangle \nthem. Lucy says, \"I hit him because he took my ball.\" Tommy says, \"I took her ball \nbecause she won't let me play with her airplane.\" Lucy says, \"He can't play with my \nairplane because he broke the propeller.\" Wise adults that we are, we say, \"Now, now, \nchildren\u2014just get along with each other.\" But are we really any different in the way we \nexplain the entanglements we find ourselves caught in? We are conditioned to see life \nas a series of events, and for every even t, we think there is one obvious cause. \nConversations in organizations are dominated by concern with events: last month's \nsales, the new budget cuts, last quarter's earnings, who just got promoted or fired, the \nnew product our competitors just announced, the delay that just was announced in our \nnew product, and so on. The media reinforces an emphasis on short-term events\u2014after \nall, if it's more than two days' old it's no longer \"news.\" Focusing on events leads to \n\"event\" explanations: \"The Dow Jones average dropped sixteen points today,\" \nannounces the newspaper, \"because low fourth-quarter profits were announced \nyesterday.\" Such explanations may be true as far as they go, but they distract us from \nseeing the longer-term patterns of change that lie behind the events and from \nunderstanding the causes of those patterns. \nOur fixation on events is actually part of our evolutionary programming. If you \nwanted to design a cave person for survival , ability to contemplate the cosmos would \nnot be a high-ranking design criterion. What is important is the ability to see the saber-\ntoothed tiger over your left shoulder and react quickly.

If we focus on events, the best we can ever do is \npredict an event before it happens so that we can react optimally. But we cannot learn \nto create. \n5. THE PARABLE OF THE BOILED FROG \nMaladaptation to gradually building threats to survival is so pervasive in systems \nstudies of corporate failure that it has given rise to the parable of the \"boiled frog.\" If \nyou place a frog in a pot of boiling water, it will immediately try to scramble out. But if \nyou place the frog in room temperature water, and don't scare him, he'll stay put. Now, \nif the pot sits on a heat source, and if you gradually turn up the temperature, something \nvery interesting happens. As the temperature rises from 70 to 80 degrees F., the frog \nwill do nothing. In fact, he will show every sign of enjoying himself. As the temperature \ngradually increases, the frog will become groggier and groggier, until he is unable to \nclimb out of the pot. Though there is nothing restraining him, the frog will sit there \nand boil. Why? Because the frog's internal apparatus for sensing threats to survival is \ngeared to sudden changes in his environment, not to slow, gradual changes. \nSomething similar happened to the American  automobile industry. In the 1960s, it \ndominated North American production. That began to change very gradually. Certainly, \nDetroit's Big Three did not see Japan as a threat to their survival in 1962, when the \nJapanese share of the U.S. market was below 4 percent. Nor in 1967 , when it was less \nthan 10 percent. Nor in 1974, when it was under 15 percent. By the time the Big Three \nbegan to look critically at its own practices and core assumptions, it was the early \n1 980 s,  a n d t h e Ja pa ne se sh a re o f th e  Am e rica n m a r ket  ha d r is en  t o  21 .3 p er cen t . B y \n1989, the Japanese share was approaching 30 percent, and the American auto industry \ncould account for only about 60 percent of the cars sold in the U.S.2 It is still not clear \nwhether this particular frog will have the strength to pull itself out of the hot water. \nLearning to see slow, gradual processes requires slowing down our frenetic pace and \npaying attention to the subtle as well as the dramatic. If you sit and look into a \ntidepool, initially you won't see much of anything going on. However, if you watch long \nenough, after about ten minutes the tidepool will suddenly come to life. The world of \nbeautiful creatures is always there, but moving a bit too slowly to be seen at first. The \nproblem is our minds are so locked in one frequency, it's as if we can only see at 78 \nrpm; we can't see anything at 33 l/3. We will not avoid the fate of the frog until we \nlearn to slow down and see the gradual processes that often pose the greatest threats. \n6.

Promoting the right people into leadership positions shapes strategy \nand organizational climate for years. These are exactly the types of decisions where \nthere is the least opportunity for trial and error learning. \nCycles are particularly hard to  see, and thus learn from, if they last longer than a year \nor two. As systems-thinking writer Draper Kauffman, Jr., points out, most people have \nshort memories. \"When a temporary oversupply of workers develops in a particular \nfield,\" he wrote, \"everyone talks about the big surplus and young people are steered \naway from the field. Within a few years, this creates a shortage, jobs go begging, and \nyoung people are frantically urged into the field\u2014which creates a surplus. Obviously, \nthe best time to start training for a job is when people have been talking about a \nsurplus for several years and few others are entering it. That way, you finish your \ntraining just as the shortage develops.\"3 \nTraditionally, organizations attempt to surmount the difficulty of coping with the \nbreadth of impact from decisions by breaking themselves up into components. They \ninstitute functional hierarchies that are easier for people to \"get their hands around.\" \nBut, functional divisions grow into fiefdoms, and what was once a convenient division \nof labor mutates into the \"stovepipes\" that all but cut off contact between functions. \nThe result: analysis of the most important problems in a company, the complex issues \nthat cross functional lines, becomes a perilous or nonexistent exercise. \n7. THE MYTH OF THE MANAGEMENT TEAM \nStanding forward to do battle with these dilemmas and disabilities is \"the \nmanagement team,\" the collection of savvy, experienced managers who represent the \norganization's different functions and areas of expertise. Together, they are supposed \nto sort out the complex cross-functional issues that are critical to the organization. \nWhat confidence do we have, really, that typical management teams can surmount these \nlearning disabilities? \nAll too often, teams in business tend to sp end their time fighting for turf, avoiding \nanything that will make them look bad pers onally, and pretending that everyone is \nbehind the team's collective strategy \u2014maintaining the appearance of a cohesive team. \nTo keep up the image, they seek to squelch disagreement; people with serious \nreservations avoid stating them publicly , and joint decisions are watered-down \ncompromises reflecting what everyone can live with, or else reflecting one person's \nview foisted on the group. If there is disagreement, it's usually expressed in a manner \nthat lays blame, polarizes opinion, and fails to reveal the underlying differences in \nassumptions and experience in a way that the team as a whole could learn. \n\"Most management teams break down under pressure,\" writes Harvard's Chris \nArgyris\u2014a longtime student of learning in management teams. \"The team may function \nquite well with routine issues. But when they confront complex issues that may be \nembarrassing or threatening, the 'teamness' seems to go to pot.\"4 \nA r g y r i s  a r g u e s  t h a t  m o s t  m a n a g e r s  f i n d  collective inquiry inherently threatening. \nSchool trains us never to admit that we do not know the answer, and most corporations \nreinforce that lesson by rewarding the people who excel in advocating their views, not \ninquiring into complex issues. (When was the last time someone was rewarded in your \norganization for raising difficult questions about the company's current policies rather \nthan solving urgent problems?) Even if we feel uncertain or ignorant, we learn to \nprotect ourselves from the pain of appearing uncertain or ignorant. That very process \nblocks out any new understandings which might threaten us.

In story after story, leaders could not see the consequences of \ntheir own policies, even when they were warn ed in advance that their own survival was \nat stake.

The British went through \"a \nfull decade,\" wrote Tuchman, \"of mounting conflict with the [American] colonies \nwithout any [British official] sending a representative, much less a minister, across the \nAtlantic . . . to find out what was endangering the relationship . . .\"6 By 1776, the start \nof the American Revolution, the relationship was irrevocably endangered. Elsewhere, \nTuchman describes the Roman Catholic cardinals of the fifteenth and sixteenth \ncenturies, a tragic management \"team\" in which piety demanded that they present an \nappearance of agreement. However, behind-the-scenes backstabbing (in some cases, \nliteral backstabbing) brought in opportunistic popes whose abuses of office provoked \nthe Protestant Reformation. \nWe live in no less perilous times today, an d the same learning disabilities persist, \nalong with their consequences.

For this reason, we often invite people to take part in a simulation called \nthe \"beer game,\" first developed in the 1960s at the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology's Sloan School of Management. Because it is a \"laboratory replica\" of a real \nsetting, rather than reality itself, we can isolate the disabilities and their causes more \nsharply than is possible in real organizations. This reveals that the problems originate in \nbasic ways of thinking and interacting, mo re than in peculiarities of organization \nstructure and policy. \nThe beer game does this by immersing us in a type of organization which is rarely \nnoticed but widely prevalent: a production/distribution system, the kind responsible for \nproducing and shipping consumer  and commercial goods in all industrial countries. In \nthis case, it's a system for producing and distributing a single brand of beer. The players \nat each position are completely free to ma ke any decision that seems prudent. Their \nonly goal is to manage their position as best they can to maximize their profits.1 \nAs with many games, the \"playing\" of a single session of the beer game can be told as \na story. There are three main characters in the story\u2014a retailer, a wholesaler, and the \nmarketing director of a brewery.2 This story is told, in turn, through each of the players' \neyes. \nTHE RETAILER \nImagine that you're a retail merchant. Perhaps you're the franchise manager of a brightly \nlit twenty-four-hour chain store at a suburban intersection. Or maybe you own a mom-\nand-pop grocery on a street of Victorian-era brownstones. Or a discount beverage outlet \non a remote highway. \nNo matter what your store lo oks like, or whatever else you sell, beer is a cornerstone \nof your business. Not only do you make a profit on it, but it draws customers in to \nbuy, perhaps, popcorn and potato chips. You stock at least a dozen different brands of \nbeer, and keep a rough tally of how many case s of each are in your  back room, which is \nwhere you keep your inventory. \nOnce each week, a trucker arrives at the rear entrance of your store. You hand him a \nform on which you've filled in that week's order. How many cases of each brand do you \nwant delivered? The trucker, after he makes his other rounds, returns your order to your \nbeer wholesaler, who then processes it, arranges outgoing orders in a proper sequence, \nand ships the resulting order to your store. Because of all that processing, you're used \nto a four-week delay on average on your orders; in other words, a delivery of beer \ngenerally arrives in your store about four weeks after you order it.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3002, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da721b99-65c9-434f-8e73-fa134f3e6841": {"__data__": {"id_": "da721b99-65c9-434f-8e73-fa134f3e6841", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

You communicate \nonly through those check marks on a piece of paper. You probably have never even met \nhim; you know only the truck driver. And that's for good reason: you have hundreds of \nproducts in your store. Dozens of wholesalers dole them out to you. Meanwhile, your \nbeer wholesaler handles deliveries to several hundred stores, in a dozen different \ncities. Between your steady deluge of customers and his order-shuffling, who has time \nfor chitchat? That single number is the on ly thing you need to say to each other. \nOne of your steadiest beer br ands is called Lover's Beer. You are dimly aware that it's \nmade by a small but efficient brewery located about three hundred miles away from you. \nIt's not a super-popular brand; in fact, the brewery doesn't advertise at all. But every \nweek, as regularly as your morning newspaper deliveries, four cases of Lover's Beer sell \nfrom the shelves. Sure, the customers are young\u2014 most are in their twenties\u2014and \nfickle; but somehow, for every one who graduates to Miller or Bud, there's a younger \nsister or brother to replace him. \nTo make sure you always have enough Lover's Beer, you try to keep twelve cases in \nthe store at any time. That means ordering fo ur cases each Monday, when the beer truck \ncomes. Week after week after week. By now, you take that four-case turnover for \ngranted; it's inextricably wedded to the image in your mind of the beer's performance. \nYou don't even articulate it to yourself when placing the order: \"Oh, yeah,\" runs the \nautomatic litany. \"Lover's Beer. Four cases.\" \nWeek 2: Without warning, one week in October (let's call it Week 2), sales of the beer \ndouble. They jump from four cases to eight. That's all right, you figure; you have an \neight-case surplus in your store. You do n't know why they've sold so much more \nsuddenly. Maybe someone is having a party. But to replace those extra cases, you raise \nyour order to eight. That will bring your inventory back to normal. \nWeek 3: Strangely enough, you also sell eight cases of Lover's Beer the next week. \nAnd it's not even spring break. Every once in a while, in those rare moments between \nsales, you briefly ponder the reason why.  There's no advertising campaign for the \nbeer; you would have received a mailing about it. Unless the mailing got lost, or you \naccidentally threw it out. Or maybe there's another reason . . . but a customer comes in, \nand you lose your train of thought. \nAt the moment the deliveryman comes, you're still not thinking much about Lover's \nBeer, but you look down at your sheet and see that he's brought only four cases this time. (It's \nfrom the order you placed four weeks ago.) You only have four cases left in stock, which means\u2014\nunless there's a drop-back in sales\u2014you're going to sell out all your Lover's Beer this week. \nPrudence dictates an order of at least eight cases to  keep up with sales. Just to be on the safe \nside, you order twelve so you can rebuild your inventory. \nWeek 4: You find time on Tuesday to quiz one or two of your younger customers. It turns \nout that a new music video appeared a month or so back on the popular cable television \nchannels. The video's recording group, the Iconoclast s, closes their song with the line, \"I take \none last sip of Lover's Beer and run into the sun.\" You don't know why they used that line, but \nWeek 2", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3448, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a1b2c881-c95f-4540-a35f-c3eba10df9db": {"__data__": {"id_": "a1b2c881-c95f-4540-a35f-c3eba10df9db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

You think of \ncalling the wholesaler, but a delivery of potato ch ips arrives and the subject of Lover's Beer slips \nyour mind. \nWhen your next delivery of beer comes in, only five cases of beer arrive. You're chagrined now \nbecause you have only one case in stock. You're almost sold out. And thanks to this video, \ndemand might go up even further. Still, you know that you have some extra cases on order, but \nyou're not sure exactly how many. Better order at least sixteen more. \nWeek 5: Your one case sells out Monday morn ing. Fortunately, you receive a shipment for \nseven more cases of Lover's (apparently your wholesaler is starting to respond to your higher \norders). But all are sold by the end of the week , leaving you with absolutely zero inventory. \nGlumly, you stare at the empty shelf. Better order another sixteen. You don't want to get a \nreputation for being out of stock of popular beers. \nWeek 6: Sure enough, customers start coming in at the beginning of the week, looking \nfor Lover's. Two are loyal enough to wait for your backlog. \"Let us know as soon as it \ncomes in,\" they say, \"and we'll be back to buy it.\" You note their names and phone \nnumbers: they've promised to buy one case each. \nOnly six cases arrive in the next shipment .

The suspense is palpable: every time a cu stomer buys a six-pack  of that quiet beer, \nyou notice it. People seem to be talking about the beer. Eagerly, you wait for the trucker \nto roll in the sixteen cases you expect. \nBut he brings only five. \"What do you mean, five?\" you say. \"Gee, I don't know \nanything about it,\" the deliveryman tells you. \"I guess they're backlogged. You'll get \nthem in a couple of weeks.\" A couple of weeks!?! By the time you call your backlogged \ncustomers, you'll be sold out before you can sell a single new case. You'll be without a \nbottle of Lover's on your shelf all week. What will this do to your reputation? \nYou place an order for twenty-four more ca ses\u2014twice as much as you had planned to \norder. What is that wholesaler doing to me, you wonder? Doesn't he know what a \nravenous market we have down here? What's going through his mind, anyway? \nTHE WHOLESALER \nAs the manager of a wholesale distributing firm, beer is your life. You spend your days \nat a steel desk in a small warehouse stacked high with beer of every conceivable brand: \nMiller, Bud, Coors, Rolling Rock, a passel of imported beers\u2014and, of course, regional \nbeers such as Lover's Beer. The region you se rve includes one large city, several smaller \nsatellite cities, a web of suburbs, and some outlying rural areas. You're not the only \nbeer wholesaler here, but you're very well established. For several small brands, \nincluding Lover's Beer, you are the only distributor in this area. \nMostly, you communicate with the brewery through the same method which retailers \nuse to reach you. You scribble numbers onto a form which you hand your driver each \nweek. Four weeks later, on average, the beer ar rives to fill that order. Instead of ordering \nby the case, however, you order by the gross. Each gross is about enough to fill a small \ntruck, so you think of them as truckloads. Just as your typical retailer orders about four \ncases of Lover's Beer from you, week af ter week after week, so you order four \ntruckloads from the brewery, week after week after week. That's enough to give you a \ntypical accumulation of twelve truckloads' worth in inventory at any given time. \nBy Week 8, you had become almost as frustrated and angry as your retailers. Lover's \nBeer had always been a reliably steady brand. But a few weeks ago\u2014in Week 4, \nactually\u2014those orders had abruptly started rising sharply. The next week, orders from \nretailers had risen still further. By Week 8, most stores were ordering three or four times \ntheir regular amount of beer. \nAt first, you had easily filled the extra orders from your inventory in the warehouse. \nAnd you had been prescient; noting that ther e was a trend, you had immediately raised \nthe amount of Lover's Beer you ordered from the brewery. In Week 6, after seeing an \narticle in Beer Distribution News about the rock video, you ha d raised your brewery order \nstill further, to a dramatic twenty truckloads per week.

But you had needed that much; the beer's popularity was \ndoubling, tripling, and even quadrupling, to judge from the stores' demand. \nBy Week 6, you had shipped out all the beer you had in inventory and entered the \nhellishness of backlog. Each week you sent out what you could, and sent the stores \npaperwork equivalents of I.O.U.s to cover the rest. A few of the larger chain stores \ncalled you and got what preferential treatmen t you could offer, but the Lover's Beer in \nyour inventory was gone. At least you knew it would be only a couple of weeks more \nbefore the extra beer you ordered would begin to arrive. \nIn Week 8, when you had called the brewery to ask if there was any way to speed up \ntheir deliveries (and to let them know that you were upping your order to thirty \ntruckloads), you were dismayed to find out that they had only just stepped up \nproduction two weeks before. They were just learning of the increase in demand. How \ncould they be so slow? \nNow it's Week 9. You're getting orders for twenty truckloads' \n \nworth of Lover's Beer per week, and you still don't have it. By the end of last week, you had \nbacklogged orders of another twenty-nine truckloads. Your staff is so used to fielding calls that \nthey've asked you to install an answering machin e devoted to an explanation about Lover's Beer. \nBut you're confident that, this week, the twenty truck-loads you ordered a month ago will finally \narrive. \nHowever, only six truckloads arrive. Apparently the brewery is still backlogged, and the larger \nproduction runs are only now starting to get shipped out. You call some of your larger chains and \nassure them that the beer they ordered will be coming shortly. \nWeek 10 is infuriating. The extra beer you were expecting\u2014at least twenty truckloads' \nworth\u2014doesn't show. The brewery simply couldn't ramp up production that fast. Or so you \nguess. They only send you eight truckloads. It's impossible to reach anybody on the phone \ndown there\u2014they're apparently all on the fa ctory floor, manning the brewery apparatus. \nThe stores, meanwhile, are apparently selling the beer wildly. You're getting unprecedented \norders\u2014for twenty-six truckloads this week. Or maybe they're ordering so much because they \ncan't get any of the beer from you. Either way, you'have to keep up. What if you can't get any of \nthe beer and they go to one of your competitors? \nYou order forty truckloa ds from the brewery. \nIn Week 11, you find yourself tempted to take extra-long lunches at the bar around the corner \nfrom your warehouse. Only twelve truckloads of Lover's Beer arrive. You still can't reach \nanybody at the brewery. And you have over a hundred truckloads' worth of orders to fill: \nseventy-seven truckloads in backlog, and another twenty-eight truckloads' worth of orders from \nthe stores which you receive this week.

This new demand for Lo ver's Beer is a far more major change than you \nexpected. You sigh with resignation when you think of how much money you could make if you \nonly had enough in stock. How could the brewery have done this to you? Why did demand have \nto rise so quickly? How are you ever expected to keep up? A ll you know is that you're never going \nto get caught in this situation again. You order sixty more truckloads. \nFor the next four weeks, the demand continues to outstrip your supply. In fact, you can't \nreduce your backlog at all in Week 13. \nYou finally start receiving larger shipments fr om the brewery in Weeks 14 and 15. At the \nsame time, orders from your stores drop off a bit. Maybe in the previo us weeks, you figure, \nthey overordered a bit. At this point, anything that helps work off your backlog is a welcome \nreprieve. \nAnd now, in Week 16, you finally get almost all the beer you asked for weeks ago: fifty-\nfive truckloads. It arrives early in the week , and you stroll back to that section of the \nwarehouse to take a look at it, stacked on pa llets. It's as much beer as you keep for \nany major brand. And it will be moving out soon. \nThroughout the week, you wait expectantly for the stores' orders to  roll in. You even \nstop by the intake desk to see the individual  forms. But on form after form, you see the \nsame number written: zero. Zero. Zero. Zero. Zero.

After all, that video is still running.

You, \nin turn, order zero truckloads from the br ewery. And yet, the brewery continues to \ndeliver beer. Sixty more truckloads appear on your dock this week. Why does that \nbrewery have it in for you? When will it ever end? \nTHE BREWERY \nImagine that you were hired four months ago to manage distribution and marketing at the \nbrewery, where Lover's Beer is only one of several primary products. Yours is a small \nbrewery, known for its quality, not its marketing savvy. That's why you were hired. \nNow, clearly, you have been doing someth ing right. Because in only your second \nmonth (Week Six of this game), new orders had begun to rise dramatically. By the end \nof your third month on the job, you felt the satisfaction of getting orders for forty gross \nworth of beer per week, up dramatically from the four when you started. And you \nshipped out . . . well, you shipped out thirty. \nBecause breweries get backlogs too. It takes (in your brewery, at least) two weeks from \nthe time you decide to brew a bottle of beer until the moment when that beer is ready for \nshipment. Admittedly, you kept a few weeks' worth of beer in your warehouse, but those \nstocks were exhausted by Week 7, only two weeks after the .rising orders came in. The \nnext week, while you had back orders for nine gross and another twenty-four gross in \nnew orders, you could send out only twenty-two gross. By that time you were a hero \nwithin your company. The plant manager had given everyone incentives to work double-\ntime, and was feverishly interv iewing for new factory help. \nYou had lucked out with that Iconoclasts' video mentioning the beer. You had \nlearned about the video in Week 3\u2014from letters written by teenagers to the \nbrewery. But it had taken until Week 6 to s ee that video translate into higher orders. \nEven by Week 14, the factory had still not caught up with its backlogged orders. \nYou had regularly requested brew batches of seventy gross or more. You had \nwondered how large your bonus would be  that year. Maybe you could ask for a \npercentage of the profits, at least once you caught up with back orders. You had even \nidly pictured yourself on the cover of Marketing Week.  \nFinally, you had caught up with the backlog in Week 16.

If every retailer in \nthis area waits six weeks before ordering any more beer, and then only orders a few cases a \nweek, it's going to be a year or more before they put a dent in those 220 truckloads sitting at \nthe wholesaler's. \"This is a tragedy,\" you say. \n\"Who let it happen\u2014I mean, how can we  keep it from happening again?\" \n\"Well, it's not our fault,\" says the retailer, after sipping some coffee. \"We were selling four \ncases of beer when that music video came out. Then, in Week 2, we sold eight cases.\" \n\"And then it mushroomed,\" you say. \"But then why did it die down?\" \n\"No, you don't understand,\" says the retailer. \"The demand never mushroomed. And it \nnever died out. We still sell eight cases of beer\u2014week after week after week. But you didn't \nsend us the beer we wanted. So we had to keep ordering, just to make sure we had enough to \nkeep up with our customers.\" \n\"But we got the beer out as soon as it was necessary.\" \n\"Then maybe the wholesaler screwed up somehow, \" says the retailer. \"I 've been wondering if \nI should switch suppliers. Anyway, I wish you'd do a coupon promotion or something, so I could \nmake back some of my costs. I'd like to  unload some of those ninety-three cases.\" \nYou pick up the tab for coffee. Then, on your trip back, you plan the wording of your \nresignation notice. Obviously, you'll be blamed for any layoffs or plant closings that come out of \nthis crisis\u2014just as the wholesaler blamed the retailer, and the retailer blamed the wholesaler, and \nboth of them wanted to blame you. At least it's early enough in the process that you can quit \nwith some dignity.

Leverage Often Comes from New Ways of Thinking  \nIn human systems, people often have potential leverage that they do \nnot exercise because they focus only on their own decisions and \nignore how their decisions affect others. In the beer game, players \nhave it in their power to elimin ate the extreme instabilities that \ninvariably occur, but they fail to do so because they do not \nunderstand how they are creating th e instability in the first place. \n \n \nPeople in the business world love heroes. We lavish praise and promotion on those \nwho achieve visible results. But if something goes wrong, we feel intuitively that \nsomebody must have screwed up. In the beer game, there are no such culprits. There \nis no one to blame. Each of the three players in our story had the best possible \nintentions: to serve his customers well, to keep the product moving smoothly through \nthe system, and to avoid penalties. Each participant made well-motivated, clearly \ndefensible judgments based on reasonable guesses about what might happen. There \nwere no villains, but there was a crisis n onetheless\u2014built into the structure of the \nsystem. \nIn the last twenty years, the beer game has been played thousands of times in classes \nand management training seminars. It has be en played on five continents, among people \nof all ages, nationalities, cultural origins, and vastly varied business backgrounds. Some \nplayers had never heard of a production/distribution system before; others had spent a \ngood portion of their lives working in such businesses. Yet every time the game is \nplayed the same crises ensue. First, there is growing demand that can't be met. Orders \nbuild throughout the system. Inventories ar e depleted. Backlogs grow. Then the beer \narrives en masse while incoming orders suddenly decline. By the end of the \nexperiment, almost all players are sitting with large inventories they cannot unload\u2014\nfor example, it is not unusual to find brewery inventory levels in the hundreds \noverhanging orders from wholesalers for eight, ten, or twelve cases per week.3 \nIf literally thousands of players, from enormously diverse backgrounds, all generate \nthe same qualitative behavior patterns, the ca uses of the behavior must lie beyond the \nindividuals. The causes of the behavior must  lie in the structure of the game itself. \nMoreover \"beer game\"-type structures create similar crises in real-life production-\ndistribution systems. For instance, in 1985 , personal computer memory chips were \ncheap and readily available; sales went down by 18 percent and American producers \nsuffered 25 to 60 percent losses.4 But in late 1986 a sudden shortage developed and was \nthen exacerbated by panic and overordering. Th e result was a 100 to 300 percent increase \nin prices for the same chips.5 A similar surge and collapse in demand occurred in the \nsemiconductor industry in 1973 to 1975. After a huge order buildup and increases in \ndelivery delays throughout the industry, demand collapsed and you could have virtually \nany product you wanted off any supplier's shel f overnight. Within a few years, Siemens, \nSignetics, Northern Telecom, Honeywell, and Schlumberger all entered the business by \nbuying weakened semiconductor manufacturers.6 \nIn mid-1989, General Motors, Ford, and Chry sler, as the May 30 Wall Street Journal \nput it, \"were simply producing far more cars than they were selling, and dealer \ninventories were piling up ... The companie s already are idling plants and laying off \nworkers at rates not seen for years.\"7 Entire national economies undergo the same \nsorts of surges in demand and inventory overadjustments, due to what economists call \nthe \"inventory accelerator\" theory of business cycles. \nSimilar boom and bust cycles continue to recur in diverse service businesses. For \nexample, real estate is notoriously cyclic, often fueled by speculators who drive up", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4061, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc65021f-2dbc-4690-8b68-74bffd377094": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc65021f-2dbc-4690-8b68-74bffd377094", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

Unfortunately, the \npeople in the real estate industry are too busy trying to address the problems they have \nleft over from the last one.\"8 \nIn fact, reality in production-distribution systems is often worse than the beer game. A \nreal retailer can order from three or four wholesalers at once, wait for the first group of \ndeliveries to arrive, and cancel the other orders. Real producers often run up against \nproduction capacity limits not present in the game, thereby exacerbating panic \nthroughout the distribution system. In turn, producers invest in additional capacity \nbecause they believe that current demand levels will continue into the future, then find \nthemselves strapped with excess capacity once demand collapses. \nThe dynamics of production-distribution systems such as the beer game illustrate the \nfirst principle of systems thinking: \nSTRUCTURE INFLUENCES BEHAVIOR \nWhen placed in the same system, people, however different, tend to produce similar results.  \nThe systems perspective tells us that we must  look beyond individual mistakes or bad \nluck to understand important problems. We must look beyond personalities and events. We \nmust look into the underlying structures which shape individual actions and create the \nconditions where types of events become likely. As Donella Meadows expresses it: \nA truly profound and different insight is the way you begin to see that the system causes \nits own behavior.9 \nThis same sentiment was expressed over a hundred years ago by a systems thinker \nof an earlier vintage. Two thirds of the way through War and Peace, Leo Tolstoy breaks \noff from his narrative about the history of Napoleon and czarist Russia to contemplate \nwhy historians, in general, are unable to explain very much: \nThe first fifteen years of the nineteenth century present the spectacle of an \nextraordinary movement of millions of men.  Men leave their habitual pursuits; rush \nfrom one side of Europe to the other; pl under, slaughter one another, triumph and \ndespair; and the whole current of life is tr ansformed and presents a quickened activity, \nfirst moving at a growing speed, and then slowly slackening again. What was the cause \nof that activity, or from what laws did it arise? asked the human intellect. \nThe historians, in reply to that inquiry, lay before us the sayings and doings of some \ndozens of men in one of the buildings in the city of Paris, summing up those doings and \nsayings by one word \u2014revolution. Then they give us a detailed biography of Napoleon, \nand of certain persons favorably or hostilely disposed to him; talk of the influence of \nsome of these persons upon others; and then say that this it is to which the activity is \ndue; and these are its laws. \nBut, the human intellect not only refuses to believe in that explanation, but flatly \ndeclares that the method of explanation is not a correct one . . . The sum of men's \nindividual wills produced both the revolution and Napoleon; and only the sum of those \nwills endured them and then destroyed them. \n\"But whenever there have been wars, there ha ve been great military leaders; whenever \nthere have been revolutions in states, th ere have been great men,\" says history. \n\"Whenever there have been great military lead ers there have, indeed, been wars,\" replies \nthe human reason; \"but that does not prove that the generals were the cause of the wars,", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4007, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01457110-619b-4986-86a1-7121a62849b8": {"__data__": {"id_": "01457110-619b-4986-86a1-7121a62849b8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

Tolstoy argues that only in trying to understand underlying \"laws of history,\" his \nown synonym for what we now call systemic structures, lies any hope for deeper \nunderstanding: \nFor the investigation of the laws of histor y, we must completely change the subject \nof observations, must let kings and ministers and generals alone, and study the \nhomogeneous, infinitesimal elements by which the masses are led. No one can say \nhow far it has been given to man to advance in that direction in understanding the \nlaws of history. But it is obvious that only in that direction lies any possibility of \ndiscovering historical laws; and that the human intellect has hitherto not devoted to \nthat method of research one millionth part of  the energy that historians have put into \nthe description of the doings of various kings, ministers, and generals . . .\" \nT h e  t e r m  \" s t r u c t u r e , \"  a s  u s e d  h e r e ,  d o e s  n o t  m e a n  t h e  \" l o g i c a l  s t r u c t u r e \"  o f  a  \ncarefully developed argument or the reporting  \"structure\" as shown by an organization \nchart. Rather, \"systemic structure\" is conc erned with the key inte rrelationships that \ninfluence behavior over time. These are not interrelationships between people, but \namong key variables, such as population, na tural resources, and food production in a \ndeveloping country; or engineers' product ideas and technical and managerial know-\nhow in a high-tech company. \nIn the beer game, the structure that caused wild swings in orders and inventories \ninvolved the multiple-stage supply chain and the delays intervening between different \nstages, the limited information available at each  stage in the system, and the goals, costs, \nperceptions, and fears that influenced individuals' orders for beer. But it is very important \nto understand that when we use the term \"systemic structure\" we  do not just mean \nstructure outside the individual. The nature of structure in human systems is subtle \nbecause we are part of the structure. This means that we often have the power to alter \nstructures within which we are operating. \nHowever, more often than not, we do not perceive that power. In fact, we usually \ndon't see the structures at play much at all. Rather, we just find ourselves feeling compelled to act \nin certain ways.  \nIn 1973, psychologist Philip Zimbardo performed an experiment in which college \nstudents were placed in the roles of prison ers and guards in a mock prison set up in the \nbasement of the psychology building at Stanford. What started as mild resistance by the \n\"prisoners\" and assertiveness by the \"guard s,\" steadily escalated into increasing \nrebelliousness and abusiveness, until the \"guard s\" began to physically abuse the \"prisoners\" \nand the experimenters felt the situation was dangerously out of control. The experiment \nwas ended prematurely, after six days, when students began to suffer from depression, \nuncontrollable crying, and psychosomatic illnesses.12 \nI'll never forget one particularly chilling illustration of the power of structure in \ninternational politics. It occurred in a privat e meeting with a high-ranking member of the \nSoviet embassy, a few months after the Soviets had sent troops into Afghanistan. The \nofficial talked, eloquently and with great si ncerity, about how the U.S.S.R. had been the \nfirst to recognize the country after its foundi ng. The U.S.S.R. had been the first to come \nto its aid, repeatedly, when there was internal strife or instability. Beginning in the late \n1970s, as threats from guerrilla factions increased, the ruling government asked for \nincreasing Soviet assistance. Modest assistan ce led to greater needs for broader help.

How can such controlling structures be recognized? How would such \nknowledge help us to be more successful in a complex system? \nThe beer game provides a laboratory for exploring how structure influences behavior. \nEach player\u2014retailer, wholesaler, and brewery \u2014made only one decision per week: how \nmuch beer to order. The retailer is the first to boost orders significantly, with orders \npeaking around Week 12. At that point, the expected beer fails to arrive on time\u2014\nbecause of backlogs at the wholesale and brewery levels. But the retailer, not thinking of \nthose backlogs, dramatically increased orders to get beer at any cost. That sudden jump \nin orders is then amplified through the whol e system\u2014first by the wholesaler, and then \nby the brewery. Wholesaler orders peak at about 40, and brewery production peaks at \nabout 80. \nThe result is a characteristic pattern of buildup and decline in orders at each \nposition, amplified in intensity as you move \"up-stream,\" from retailers to breweries. In \nother words, the further from the ultimate c onsumer, the higher the orders, and the more \ndramatic the collapse. In fa ct, virtually all brewery players go through major crises, \nending with near-zero production rates only weeks after having produced 40, 60, 100 or \nmore gross per week.13 \nThe other characteristic pattern of behavior in the game can be seen in the \ninventories and backlogs. The retailer's inventory begins to drop below zero at around \nWeek 5. The retailer's backlog continues to  increase for several weeks and the retailer \ndoesn't get back to a positive inventory until around Weeks 12 to 15. Similarly, the \nwholesaler is in backlog from around Week 7 through around Weeks 15 to 18, and the \nbrewery from Week 9 through Weeks 18 to 20. Once inventories begin to accumulate, \nthey reach large values (about 40 for the retail er, 80 to 120 for the wholesaler, and 60 to \n80 for the brewery by Week 30)\u2014much larger than intended. So each position goes \nthrough an inventory-backlog cycle: first there is insufficient inventory, then there is too \nmuch inventory. \nThese characterisic patterns of overshoot and collapse in ordering and inventory-\nbacklog cycles occur despite stable consumer demand. The actual consumer orders \nexperienced only one change. In Week 2, consumer orders doubled\u2014going from four \ncases of beer per week to eight. They remained  at eight cases per week for the rest of the \ngame. \nIn other words, after a one-time increase, consumer demand, for the rest of the \nsimulation, was perfectly flat! Of course, none of the players other than the retailer knew \nconsumer demand, and even the retailers saw demand only week by week, with no clue \nabout what would come next. \nAfter the beer game, we ask the people who played wholesalers and brewers to draw \nwhat they think the consumer orders were. Most draw a curve which rises and falls, \njust as their orders rose and fell.14 In other words, the players assume that if orders in \nthe game rose and collapsed, this must have been due to a surge and collapse in \nconsumer orders. Such assumptions of an \"external cause\" are characteristic of \nnonsystemic thinking. \nPlayers' guesses regarding consumer demand  shed light on our deeply felt need to \nfind someone or something to blame when there are problems. Initially, after the game is \nover, many believe that the culprits are the players in the other positions. This belief is \nshattered by seeing that the same problems arise in all plays of the game, regardless of \nwho is manning the different positions. Many then direct their search for a scapegoat \ntoward the consumer. \"There must have been  a wild buildup and collapse in consumer \ndemand,\" they reason. But when their guesses are compared with the flat customer \norders, this theory too is shot down. \nThis has a devastating impact on some players.

In fact, given the \"physical system\" of inventories, \nshipping delays, and limited information, there is substantial room for improving most \nteam's scores. \nREDEFINING YOUR SCOPE OF INFLUENCE: HOW TO IMPROVE \nPERFORMANCE IN THE BEER GAME \nTo begin to see the possibilities for improv ement, consider the outcomes if each \nplayer did nothing to correct  his inventory or backlog. Following the \"no strategy\" \nstrategy, each player would simply place new or ders equal to orders he received. This is \nabout the simplest ordering policy possible. If you receive new incoming orders for four \ncases of beer, you place orders for four. If you receive incoming orders for eight, you \nplace orders for eight. Given the pattern of consumer demand in this game, that means \nordering four cases or truckloads every week \u2014until you receive your first order of eight. \nThereafter you order eight. \nWhen this strategy is followed unswervingly  by all three players, all three positions \nsettle into a form of stability by Week 11. The retailer and wholesaler never quite catch \nup with their backlogs. Backlogs develop, as in the basic game, due to the delays in \ngetting orders filled. Backlogs persist because the players make no effort to correct them\u2014\nbecause the \"no strategy\" strategy precludes placing the orders in excess of orders \nreceived needed to correct backlogs. \nIs the \"no strategy\" strategy successful? Pr obably, most players would say no. After \nall, the strategy generates persistent backlogs. This means that everyone throughout the \nsystem is kept waiting longer than necessary for his orders to be filled. In real life, such \na situation would, undoubtedly, invite competitors to enter a market and provide better \ndelivery service. Only producers/distributors  with monopolies on markets would be likely \nto stick to such a strategy.15 \nBut the strategy eliminates the buildup and collapse in ordering, and the associated \nwild swings in inventories. Moreover, total cost generated by all positions in the \"no \nstrategy\" strategy is lower than what is achieved by 75 percent of the teams that play the \ngame!16 In other words, the majority of player s in the game, many of them experienced \nmanagers, do much worse than if they simply placed orders equal to the orders they \nreceive. In trying to correct the imbalances  that result from \"doing nothing,\" most \nplayers make matters worse, in many cases dramatically worse. \nOn the other hand, about 25 percent of the players score better than the \"no \nstrategy\" strategy, and about 10 percent score very much better. In other words, \nsuccess is possible. But it requires a shift of view for most players. It means getting to \nthe heart of fundamental mismatches betw een common ways of thinking about the \ngame\u2014what we will later call our \"mental mode l\" of it\u2014and the actual reality of how \nthe game works. Most players see their job as \"managing their position\" in isolation \nfrom the rest of the system. What is required is to see how their position interacts with \nthe larger system. \nConsider how you feel if you are a typical player at any position. You pay close \nattention to your own inventory, costs, backlog, orders, and shipments.

Likewise, you have only a fuzzy concept of what \nhappens to the orders you place; you simply expect them to show up as new shipments \nafter a reasonable delay. Your perspective of the system looks something like this: \n \nGiven this picture of the situation, if you need beer it makes sense to place more \norders. If your beer doesn't arrive when expected, you place still more orders. Given this \npicture of the situation, your job is to \"manage your position,\" reacting to changes in \nthe \"external imputs\" of incoming orders, beer arrivals, and your supplier's delivery delay. \nWhat the typical \"manage your position\" view  misses is the ways that your orders \ninteract with others' orders to influence th e variables you perceive as \"external.\" The \nplayers are part of a larger system that most perceive only dimly. For example, if they \nplace a large number of orders, they can wipe out their supplier's inventory, thereby \ncausing their supplier's delivery delay to increa se. If they, then, respond (as many do) by \nplacing still more orders, they create a \"vicious cycle\" that increases problems \nthroughout the system. \nThis vicious cycle can be set off by any player who panics, anywhere within the \nsystem\u2014be he retailer, or wholesaler. Even factories can create the same effect, simply \nby failing to produce enough beer. Eventually, as one vicious circle influences other \nvicious circles, the resulting panic spreads up and down the entire production-\ndistribution system. Once the panic builds momentum, I have seen players generate \norders that are twenty to fifty times what is actually needed to correct real inventory \nimbalances. \nTo improve performance in the beer game  players must redefine their scope of \ninfluence. As a player in any position, your influence is broader than simply the limits of \nyour own position. You don't simply place orders which go off into the ether and return \nas beer supplies; those orders influence your  supplier's behavior.

I call this the \"Take two aspirin and wait\" rule. If you have a \nheadache and need to take aspirin, you don't keep taking aspirin every five minutes until \nyour headache goes away. You wait patiently for the aspirin to take effect because you \nknow that aspirin operates with a delay. Many players keep ordering beer every week \nuntil their inventory discrepancy goes away. \nSecond, don't panic. When your supplier can' t get you the beer you want as quickly as \nnormal, the worst thing you can do is order more beer. Yet, that is exactly what many \nplayers do. It takes discipline to contain th e overwhelming urge to order more when \nbacklogs are building and your customers are screaming. But, without that discipline, you \nand everyone else will suffer. \nThese guidelines are consistently missed by most players because they are evident only \nif you understand the interactions that cross the boundaries between different \npositions. The \"take two aspirin and wait\" guideline comes from understanding the \ndelay embedded in the response of your supplier's shipments to changes in your \norders placed. The \"don't panic\" guideline comes from understanding the vicious cycle \ncreated when your orders placed exacerbate your supplier's delivery delay. \nHow well can players do if they follow these guidelines? \nIt is not possible to totally eliminate all overshoots in orders and all \ninventory/backlog cycles. It is possible to hold these instabilities to a very modest level, a \nsmall fraction of what occurred in Lover's Beer. It is possible to achieve total costs that \nare one fifth of the \"do nothing\" strategy, or about one tenth the typical costs achieved \nby teams. In other words, substantial improvements are possible. \nTHE LEARNING DISABILITIES AND OUR WAYS OF THINKING \nAll of the learning disabilities described in Chapter 2 operate in the beer game: \n\u2022 Because they \"become their position,\" people do not see how their actions affect \nthe other positions. \n\u2022 Consequently, when problems arise, they quickly blame each other\u2014\"the enemy\" \nbecomes the players at the other pos itions, or even the customers. \n\u2022 When they get \"proactive\" and place more orders, they make matters worse.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2389, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2593b8dc-9ec2-459d-8542-4ac9f89a974b": {"__data__": {"id_": "2593b8dc-9ec2-459d-8542-4ac9f89a974b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

For most, the overall \nexperience of playing the game is deeply dissat isfying because it is purely reactive. Yet, \nmost eventually realize that the source of th e reactiveness lies in their own focus on week-\nby-week events. Most of the players in the game get overwhelmed by the shortages of \ninventory, surges in incoming orders, disappointing arrivals of new beer. When asked to \nexplain their decisions, they give classic \"event explanations.\" I ordered forty at Week 11 \nbecause my retailers ordered thirty-six and wiped out my inventory.\" So long as they \npersist in focusing on events, they are doomed to reactiveness. \nThe systems perspective shows that there are multiple levels of explanation in any \ncomplex situation, as suggested by the diagram below. In some sense, all are equally \n\"true.\" But their usefulness is quite different. Event explanations\u2014\"who did what to \nwhom\"\u2014 doom their holders to a reactive stance. As discussed earlier, event \nexplanations are the most common in contemporary culture, and that is exactly why \nreactive management prevails. \nSystemic Structure (generative) \nPatterns of Behavior (responsive) \nEvents (reactive) \nPattern of behavior explanations focus on seeing longer-term trends and assessing \ntheir implications. For example, in the beer game, a pattern of behavior explanation \nwould be: \"Production/distribution systems are inherently prone to cycles and \ninstability, which become more severe th e further you move from the retailer. \nTherefore, sooner or later, severe crises are likely at the brewery.\" Pattern of behavior \nexplanations begin to break the grip of short-term reactiveness. At least they suggest \nhow, over a longer term, we can respond to shifting trends.19 \nThe third level of explanation, the \"structural\" explanation, is the least common and most \npowerful. It focuses on answering the question, \"What causes the patterns of behavior?\" \nIn the beer game, a structural explanation must show how orders placed, shipments, and \ninventory interact to generate the observed patterns of instability and amplification; \ntaking into account the effects of built-in delays in filling new orders, and the vicious cycle \nthat arises when rising delivery delays le ad to more orders placed. Though rare, \nstructural explanations, when they are clear and widely understood, have considerable \nimpact. \nAn exceptional example of a leader provid ing such insight was Franklin Roosevelt, \nwhen he went on the radio on March 12, 1933, to explain the four-day \"banking \nholiday.\" In a time of panic, Roosevelt calmly explained how the banking system \nworked, structurally. \"Let me state the simp le fact that when you deposit money in a \nbank the bank does not put the money into a safe-deposit vault,\" he said. \"It invests \nyour money in many different forms of credit\u2014 bonds, mortgages.

In so doing, he generated public support for a radical but \nnecessary action, and began his reputation as a master of public communication.20 \nThe reason that structural explanations are so important is that only they address \nthe underlying causes of behavior at a level that patterns of behavior can be changed. \nStructure produces behavior, and changing un derlying structures can produce different \npatterns of behavior. In this sense, structural explanations are inherently generative. \nMoreover, since structure in human systems includes the \"operating policies\" of the \ndecision makers in the system, redesigning our own decision making redesigns the \nsystem structure.21 \nFor most players of the game, the deepest in sight usually comes when they realize that \ntheir problems, and their hopes for improvement, are inex tricably tied to how they think. \nGenerative learning cannot be sustained in an organization where event thinking \npredominates. It requires a conceptual framework of \"structural\" or systemic thinking, \nthe ability to discover structural causes of behavior. Enthusiasm for \"creating our \nfuture\" is not enough. \nAs the players in the beer game come to understand the structures that cause its \nbehavior, they see more clearly their power to change that behavior, to adopt ordering \npolicies that work in the larger system.

Or, \neven more insidiously, they learn that a new citywide outbreak of \ndrug-related crime is the result of federal officials intercepting a large \nshipment of narcotics\u2014which reduced the drug supply, drove up the \nprice, and caused more crime by ad dicts desperate to maintain their \nhabit.  \nSolutions that merely shift problems from one part of a system to \nanother often go undetected because, unlike the rug merchant, those \nwho \"solved\" the first problem are different from those who inherit \nthe new problem.  \n2. The harder you push, the harder the system pushes back.  \nIn George Orwell's Animal Farm, the horse Boxer always had the \nsame answer to any difficulty: \"I will work harder,\" he said. At first, his \nwell-intentioned diligence inspired everyone, but gradually, his hard \nwork began to backfire in subtle  ways. The harder he worked, the \nmore work there was to do. What he didn't know was that the pigs \nwho managed the farm were actually manipulating them all for their \nown profit. Boxer's diligence actually helped to keep the other animals \nfrom seeing what the pigs were doing.3 Systems thinking has a name for \nthis phenomenon: \"Compensating feedback\": when well-intentioned \ninterventions call forth responses from the system that offset the \nbenefits of the intervention. We all know what it feels like to be facing \ncompensating feedback\u2014the harder you push, the harder the system \npushes back; the more effort you expend trying to improve matters, \nthe more effort seems to be required.  \nExamples of compensating feedback are legion. Many of the best \nintentioned government interventions fall prey to compensating \nfeedback. In the 1960s there were  massive programs to build low-\nincome housing and improve job skills in decrepit inner cities in the \nUnited States. Many of these cities were even worse off in the 1970s \ndespite the largesse of government aid. Why? One reason was that \nlow-income people migrated from other cities and from rural areas to \nthose cities with the best aid programs. Eventually, the new housing \nunits became overcrowded and the job training programs were", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2524, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02f04820-f670-4027-8e9d-09ee4d10a082": {"__data__": {"id_": "02f04820-f670-4027-8e9d-09ee4d10a082", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

All the while, the city's tax base continued \nto erode, leaving more people trapped in economically depressed \nareas.  \nSimilar compensating feedback processes have operated to thwart \nfood and agricultural assistance to developing countries. More food \navailable has been \"compensated for\" by reduced deaths due to \nmalnutrition, higher net populati on growth, and eventually more \nmalnutrition.  \nSimilarly, efforts to correct the U.S. trade imbalance by letting the \nvalue of the dollar fall in the mid-1980s were compensated for by \nforeign competitors who let prices of their goods fall in parallel (for \ncountries whose currency was \"pegged to the dollar,\" their prices \nadjusted automatically). Efforts by foreign powers to suppress indig-\nenous guerrilla fighters often lead to further legitimacy for the guer-\nrillas' cause, thereby strengthenin g their resolve and support, and \nleading to still further resistance.  \nMany companies experience compensating feedback when one of \ntheir products suddenly starts to lose its attractiveness in the market. \nThey push for more aggressive marketing; that's what always \nworked in the past, isn't it? They spend more on advertising, and \ndrop the price; these methods may br ing customers back temporarily, \nbut they also draw money away from the company, so it cuts corners \nto compensate. The quality of its service (say, its delivery speed or \ncare in inspection) starts to decl ine. In the long run, the more \nfervently the company markets, the more customers it loses.  \nNor is compensating feedback limited to \"large systems\"\u2014there \nare plenty of personal examples. Take the person who quits smoking \nonly to find himself gaining weight and suffering such a loss in self-\nimage that he takes up smoking again to relieve the stress. Or the \nprotective mother who wants so much for her young son to get along \nwith his schoolmates that she repeatedly steps in to resolve problems \nand ends up with a child who never learns to settle differences by \nhimself. Or the enthusiastic newcomer so eager to be liked that she \nnever responds to subtle criticisms of her work and ends up embit-\ntered and labeled \"a difficult person to work with.\"  \nPushing harder, whether through an increasingly aggressive inter-\nvention or through increasingly stressful withholding of natural in-\nstincts, is exhausting.

Behavior grows better before it grows worse.  \nLow-leverage interventions would be much less alluring if it were not \nfor the fact that many actually wo rk, in the short term. New houses \nget built. The unemployed are trai ned. Starving children are spared. \nLagging orders turn upward. We stop smoking, relieve our child's \nstress, and avoid a confrontation with a new coworker. Compensating \nfeedback usually involves  a \"delay,\" a time lag between the short-term \nbenefit and the long-term disbenefit. The New Yorker once published a \ncartoon in which a man sitting in an armchair pushes over a giant \ndomino encroaching upon him from the left. \"At last, I can relax,\" he's \nobviously telling himself in the cartoon. Of course, he doesn't see that \nthe domino is toppling another domino, which in turn is about to \ntopple another, and another, and that the chain of dominoes behind \nhim will eventually circle around his chair and strike him from the \nright.  \nThe better before worse response to many management interven-\ntions is what makes political decisi on making so counterproductive. By \n\"political decision making,\" I mean situations where factors other \nthan the intrinsic merits of altern ative courses of action weigh in \nmaking decisions\u2014factors such as building one's own power base, \nor \"looking good,\" or \"pleasing the boss.\" In complex human systems \nthere are always many ways to make things look better in the short \nrun. Only eventually does the comp ensating feedback come back to \nhaunt you.  \nThe key word is \"eventually.\" The delay in, for example, the \ncircle of dominoes, explains why systemic problems are so hard to \nrecognize. A typical solution feels wo nderful, when it first cures the \nsymptoms. Now there's improvemen t; or maybe even the problem \nhas gone away. It may be two, three, or four years before the problem \nreturns, or some new, worse problem arrives. By that time, given \nhow rapidly most people move from job to job, someone new is \nsitting in the chair.  \n4.

Sometimes the keys are indeed under the street \nlamp; but very often they are off in the darkness. After all, if the \nsolution were easy to see or obvious to everyone, it probably would \nalready have been found. Pushing harder and harder on familiar \nsolutions, while fundamental problems persist or worsen, is a reliable \nindicator of nonsystemic thinking\u2014what we often call the \"what we \nneed here is a bigger hammer\" syndrome.  \n5. The cure can be worse than the disease.  \nSometimes the easy or familiar solution is not only ineffective; some-\ntimes it is addictive and dangerous.  Alcoholism, for instance, may start \nas simple social drinking\u2014a solution to the problem of low self-esteem \nor work-related stress. Gradually, the cure becomes worse than the \ndisease; among its other problems it makes self-esteem and stress even \nworse than they were to begin with.  \nThe long-term, most insidious consequence of applying nonsystemic \nsolutions is increased need for more and more of the solution. This is \nwhy ill-conceived government interventions are not just inef- -fective, \nthey are \"addictive\" in the sense of  fostering increased dependency and \nlessened abilities of local people to solve their own problems. The \nphenomenon of short-term improvements leading to long-term \ndependency is so common, it has its own name among systems \nthinkers\u2014it's called \"Shifting the Burden to the Inter-venor.\" The \nintervenor may be federal assistance to cities, food relief agencies, or \nwelfare programs. All \"help\" a host  system, only to leave the system \nfundamentally weaker than before and more in need of further help.  \nFinding examples of shifting the burden to the intervenor, as natural \nresource expert and writer Donella Meadows says, \"is easy and fun and \nsometimes horrifying\"4 and hardly limited to government intervenors. \nWe shift the burden of doing simple math from our knowledge of \narithmetic to a dependency on pocket calculators.

If salespeople can't meet targets, \nwe think we need new sales incentives or promotions. If there is \ninadequate housing, we build more houses. If there is inadequate food, \nthe solution must be more food.  \nAs the players in the beer game described in Chapter 3 eventually \ndiscover, the root of our difficulties is neither recalcitrant problems \nnor evil adversaries\u2014but ourselves. There is a fundamental mismatch \nbetween the nature of reality in complex systems and our predominant \nways of thinking about that reality.

Systems thinkers refer to  this principle as \"leverage.\"  \nTackling a difficult problem is often a matter of seeing where the \nhigh leverage lies, a change wh ich\u2014with a minimum of effort\u2014 \nwould lead to lasting, significant improvement.  \nThe only problem is that high-lev erage changes are usually highly \nnonobvious to most participants in the system. They are not \"close in \ntime and space\" to obvious problem symptoms. This is what makes \nlife interesting.  \nBuckminster Fuller had a wonderful illustration of leverage that also \nserved as his metaphor for the principle of leverage\u2014the \"trim tab.\" A \ntrim tab is a small \"rudder on the rudder\" of a ship. It is only a \nfraction the size of the rudder. Its func tion is to make it easier to turn \nthe rudder, which, then, makes it easier to turn the ship. The larger \nthe ship, the more important is the trim tab because a large volume of \nwater flowing around the rudder can make it difficult to turn.  \nBut what makes the trim tab such a marvelous metaphor for leverage \nis not just its effectiveness, but its nonobviousness. If you knew \nabsolutely nothing about hydrodynamics and you saw a large oil \ntanker plowing through the high seas, where would you push if you \nwanted the tanker to turn left? You would probably go to the bow \nand try to push it to the left. Do you have any idea how much force it \nrequires to turn an oil tanker going fifteen knots by pushing on its \nbow? The leverage lies in going to the stern and pushing the tail end of \nthe tanker to the right, in order to turn the front to the left. This, of \ncourse, is the job of the rudder. Bu t in what direction does the rudder \nturn in order to get the ship's stern to turn to the right? Why to the \nleft, of course.  \nYou see, ships turn because their rear end is \"sucked around.\" \nThe rudder, by being turned into the oncoming water, compresses \nthe water flow and creates a pressure differential. The pressure dif-\nferential pulls the stern in the opposite direction as the rudder is \nturned. This is exactly the same way that an airplane flies: the air-\nplane's wing creates a pressure differential and the airplane is \n\"sucked\" upward.  \nThe trim tab\u2014this very small devi ce that has an enormous effect \non the huge ship\u2014does the same for the rudder. When it is turned \nto one side or the other, it compresses the water flowing around the \nrudder and creates a small pressure differential that \"sucks the rud-", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2615, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b1a5829-927a-4e2f-beec-6f82e1659184": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b1a5829-927a-4e2f-beec-6f82e1659184", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

As three blind \nmen encountered an elephant, each exclaimed aloud. \"It is a large \nrough thing, wide and broad, like a rug,\" said the first, grasping an ear. \nThe second, holding the trunk, said, \"I have the real facts.

Interestingly, \nthe Sufi story concludes by observing that \"Given these men's way \nof knowing, they will never know an elephant.\"  \nSeeing \"whole elephants\" does not mean that every organizational \nissue can be understood only by l ooking at the entire organization. \nSome issues can be understood only by looking at how major functions \nsuch as manufacturing, marketing, and research interact; but there are \nother issues where critical system ic forces arise within a given \nfunctional area; and others where the dynamics of an entire industry \nmust be considered. The key principl e, called the \"principle of the \nsystem boundary,\" is that the interactions that must be examined are \nthose most important to the issue at hand, regardless of parochial \norganizational boundaries.  \nWhat makes this principle difficult to practice is the way organi-\nzations are designed to keep peopl e from seeing important interac-\ntions.

Perhaps for the first time in \nhistory, humankind has the capacity to create far more information \nthan anyone can absorb, to foster far greater interdependency than \nanyone can manage, and to accelerate change far faster than \nanyone's ability to keep pace. Certainly the scale of complexity is \nwithout precedent. All around us  are examples of \"systemic \nbreakdowns\"\u2014problems such as global warming, ozone depletion, the \ninternational drug trade, and the U.S. trade and budget deficits \u2014\nproblems that have no simple local ca use. Similarly, organizations break \ndown, despite individual brilliance and innovative products, because \nthey are unable to pull their diverse functions and talents into a \nproductive whole.  \nComplexity can easily undermine confidence and responsibility\u2014 as \nin the frequent refrain, \"It's all too complex for me,\" or \"There's \nnothing I can do. It's the system.\" Systems thinking is the antidote to \nthis sense of helplessness that many feel as we enter the \"age of \ninterdependence.\" Systems thinking  is a discipline for seeing the \n\"structures\" that underlie complex situations, and for discerning \nhigh from low leverage change. That is, by seeing wholes we learn how \nto foster health. To do so, systems thinking offers a language that \nbegins by restructuring how we think.  \nI call systems thinking the fifth discipline because it is the conceptual \ncornerstone that underlies all of the five learning disciplines of this \nbook. All are concerned with a shift of mind from seeing parts to \nseeing wholes, from seeing people as helpless reactors to seeing them \nas active participants in shaping their reality, from reacting to the \npresent to creating the future. Without systems thinking, there is \nneither the incentive nor the means to integrate the learning disci-\nplines once they have come into practice. As the fifth discipline, \nsystems thinking is the cornerstone of how learning organizations \nthink about their world.  \nThere is no more poignant example of the need for systems thinking \nthan the U.S.-U.S.S.R. arms race. While the world has stood and \nwatched for the past forty years, the two mightiest political powers \nhave engaged in a race to see who could get fastest to where no one \nwanted to go.

The United States responds to  a perceived Threat to \nAmericans by increasing U.S. arms, which increases the Threat to the \nSoviets, which leads to more Soviet arms, which increases the Threat \nto the United States, which leads to more U.S. arms, which increases \nthe Threat to the Soviets, which . . . and so on, and so on. From their \nindividual viewpoints, each side achieves its short-term goal. Both \nsides respond to a perceived threat. But their actions end up creating \nthe opposite outcome, increased threat, in the long run. Here, as in \nmany systems, doing the obvious thing does not produce the obvious, desired \noutcome. The long-term result of each side's efforts to be more secure \nis heightened insecurity for all, with a combined nuclear stockpile of \nten thousand times the total firepower of world War II.  \nInterestingly, both sides failed for years to adopt a true systems \nview, despite an abundance of \"systems analysts,\" sophisticated \nanalyses of each others' nuclear arsenals, and complex computer \nsimulations of attack and counterattack war scenarios.2 Why then \nhave these supposed tools for dealing with complexity not empowered \nus to escape the illogic of the arms race?  \nThe answer lies in the same reason that sophisticated tools of \nforecasting and business analysis, as well as elegant strategic plans, \nusually fail to produce dramatic breakthroughs in managing a business. \nThey are all designed to handle the sort of complexity in which there are \nmany variables: detail complexity. But there are two types of complexity. The \nsecond type is dynamic complexity, situations where cause and effect are \nsubtle, and where the effects over time of interventions are not \nobvious. Conventional forecasting, planning, and analysis methods are \nnot equipped to deal with dynamic complexity. Mixing many \ningredients in a stew involves detail complexity, as does following a \ncomplex set of instructions to assemble a machine, or taking inventory \nin a discount retail store. But none of these situations is especially \ncomplex dynamically.  \nWhen the same action has dramatically different effects in the \nshort run and the long, there is dynamic complexity. When an action \nhas one set of consequences locally and a very different set of con-\nsequences in another part of the system, there is dynamic complexity. \nWhen obvious interventions produce nonobvious consequences, there \nis dynamic complexity.

Most are embedded in linear ways of seeing. They are at best \npartially accurate, inherently biased toward describing portions of \nreciprocal processes, not the entire processes.  \nAnother idea overturned by the feedback perspective is anthro-\npocentrism\u2014or seeing ourselves as the center of activities. The simple \ndescription, \"I am filling the glass of water,\" suggests a world of human \nactors standing at the center of activity, operating on an inanimate \nreality. From the systems perspective, the human actor is part of the feedback \nprocess, not standing apart from it. This represents a profound shift in awareness. \nIt allows us to see how we are continually both influenced by and \ninfluencing our reality. It is the shift in awareness so ardently \nadvocated by ecologists in their cries that we see ourselves as part of \nnature, not separate from nature. It is the shift in awareness \nrecognized by many (but not all) of the world's great philosophical \nsystems\u2014for example, the Bhagavad Gita's chastisement:  \nAll actions are wrought by the qualities of nature only. The self, \ndeluded by egoism, thinketh: \"I am the doer.\"7 \nIn addition, the feedback concept complicates the ethical issue of \nresponsibility. In the arms race, who is responsible? From each \nside's linear view, responsibility clearly lies with the other side: \"It is \ntheir aggressive actions, and their nationalistic intent, that are causing \nus to respond by buildin g our arms.\" A linear view always suggests a \nsimple locus of responsibility. When things go wrong, this is seen as \nblame\u2014\"he, she, it did it\"\u2014or guilt\u2014\"I did it.\" At a deep level, \nthere is no difference between blame and guilt, for both spring from \nlinear perceptions. From the linear view, we are always looking for \nsomeone or something that must be responsible\u2014they can even be \ndirected toward hidden agents within ourselves. When my son was \nfour years old, he used to say, \"My stomach won't let me eat it,\" \nwhen turning down his vegetables. We may chuckle, but is his \nassignment of responsibility really different from the adult who says, \n\"My neuroses keep me from trusting people.\"  \nIn mastering systems thinking, we give up the assumption that \nthere must be an individual, or individual agent, responsible. The \nfeedback perspective suggests that everyone shares responsibility for problems \ngenerated by a system.

This leads her teacher to form an \nopinion that she is unmotivated. Next semester, the teacher pays \nless attention to Jane and she does poorly again, withdrawing further. \nOver time, Jane gets caught in an ever-worsening spiral of withdrawal, \npoor performance, \"labeling\" by her teachers, inattention, and further \nwithdrawing.

A \nbank run produces an accelerating decline in a bank's deposits.  \nFolk wisdom speaks of reinforcing loops in terms such as \"snowball \neffect,\" \"bandwagon effect,\" or \"vicious circle,\" and in phrases \ndescribing particular systems: \"the rich get richer and the poor get \npoorer.\" In business, we know that \"momentum is everything,\" in \nbuilding confidence in a new product or within a fledgling organization. \nWe also know about reinforcing sp irals running the wrong way. \"The \nrats are jumping ship\" sugg ests a situation where, as soon as a few \npeople lose confidence, their defectio n will cause others to defect in a \nvicious spiral of eroding confidence.

So do exti nctions of corporations.  \nBut pure accelerating growth or decline rarely continues un-\nchecked in nature, because reinfo rcing processes rarely occur in \nisolation. Eventually, limits are encountered\u2014which can slow \ngrowth, stop it, divert it, or even reverse it.

If the system's goal is one you like, you will be happy. If it is \nnot, you will find all your efforts to change matters frustrated\u2014 until \nyou can either change the goal or weaken its influence.  \nNature loves a balance\u2014but many times, human decision makers act \ncontrary to these balances, and pay the price. For example, managers \nunder budget pressure often cut back staff to lower costs, but \neventually discover that their rema ining staff is now overworked, and \ntheir costs have not gone down at all\u2014because the remaining work \nhas been farmed out to consultants, or because overtime has made \nup the difference. The reason that  costs don't stay down is that the \nsystem has its own agenda. There is an implicit goal, unspoken but very \nreal\u2014the amount of work that is expected to get done.  \nIn a balancing (stabilizing) system, there is a self-correction that \nattempts to maintain some goal or target. Filling the glass of water is a \nbalancing process with the goal of a full glass. Hiring new employees is \na balancing process with the goal of having a target work force size or \nrate of growth.

EVENTUALLY  \nAs we've seen, systems seem to have  minds of their own. Nowhere is \nthis more evident than in delays\u2014interruptions between your actions \nand their consequences. Delays can make you badly overshoot your \nmark, or they can have a positive effect if you recognize them and \nwork with them.  \n\"One of the highest leverage points for improving system perfor-\nmance,\" says Ray Stata, CEO of Analog Devices, \"is the minimization \nof system delays.\" Stata is referring to an increasing awareness on \nthe part of American manufacturer s that while they have worked \ntraditionally to control tightly the amount of inventory in warehouses, \ntheir Japanese counterparts have concentrated on reducing delays\u2014a \nmuch more successful effort. \"The way leading companies manage \ntime,\" says George Stalk, vice president of the Boston Consulting \nGroup, \"\u2014in production, in new pr oduct development, in sales and \ndistribution\u2014represents the most powerful new source of competitive \ndisadvantage.\"  \nDelays between actions and consequences are everywhere in \nhuman systems. We invest now to re ap a benefit in the distant future; \nwe hire a person today but it may be  months before he or she is fully \nproductive; we commit re sources to a new proj ect knowing that it \nwill be years before it will pay off.  But delays are often unappreciated \nand lead to instability. For example, the decision makers in the beer \ngame consistently misjudged the delays that kept them from getting \norders filled when they thought they would.  \nDelays, when the effect of one variable on anot her takes time, \nconstitute the third basic building  block for a systems language. Vir-\ntually all feedback processes have some form of delay. But often the \ndelays are either unrecognized or not well understood. This can \nresult in \"overshoot,\" going further than needed to achieve a desired \nresult.

We had come to a small dam, and put in to \nshore to portage around the obstacle. A second group arrived, and \na young man who had been drinking decided to take his rubber raft \nover the dam. When the raft overturned after going over the dam, he \nwas dumped into the freezing water. Unable to reach him, we \nwatched in horror as he struggled desperately to swim downstream \nagainst the backwash at the base of the dam. His struggle lasted only a \nfew minutes; then he died of hypothermia. Immediately, his limp body \nwas sucked down into the swirling water. Seconds later, it popped up, \nten yards downstream, free of the maelstrom at the base of the dam. \nWhat he had tried in vain to achieve in the last moments of his life, the \ncurrents accomplished for him within seconds after his death. \nIronically, it was his very struggle against the forces at the base of the \ndam that killed him. He didn't know that the only way out was \n\"counterintuitive. If he hadn't tried to keep his head above water, \nbut instead dived down to where the current flowed downstream, he \nwould have survived.

Structures of which we are unaware hold us \nprisoner. Conversely, learning to see th e structures within which we \noperate begins a process of freeing ourselves from previously unseen \nforces and ultimately mastering the ability to work with them and \nchange them.  \nOne of the most important, and potentially most empowering, in-\nsights to come from the young field of systems thinking is that certain \npatterns of structure recur again and again. These \"systems arche-\ntypes\" or \"generic structures\" embody the key to learning to see \nstructures in our personal and organizational Jives. The systems ar-\nchetypes\u2014of which there are only a relatively small number'\u2014suggest \nthat not all management proble ms are unique, something that \nexperienced managers know intuitively.  \nIf reinforcing and balancing feedback and delays are like the nouns \nand verbs of systems thinking, then the systems archetypes are anal-\nogous to basic sentences or simple stories that get retold again and \nagain. Just as in literature there are common themes and recurring \nplot lines that get recast with different characters and settings, a \nrelatively small number of these archetypes are common to a very \nlarge variety of management situations.  \nThe systems archetypes reveal an elegant simplicity underlying the \ncomplexity of management issues. As  we learn to recognize more and \nmore of these archetypes, it becomes possible to see more and more \nplaces where there is leverage in facing difficult challenges, and to \nexplain these opportunities to others.  \nAs we learn more about the sy stems archetypes , they will no \ndoubt contribute toward one of our most vexing problems, a problem \nagainst which managers and leaders struggle incessantly\u2014speciali-\nzation and the fractionation of knowledge.

The systems archetypes provide that \nlanguage. They can make explicit much of what otherwise is simply \n\"management judgment.''  \nMastering the systems archetypes starts an organization on the \npath of putting the systems perspective into practice. It is not enough \nto espouse systems thinking, to say, \"We must look at the big picture \nand take the long-term view.\" It is not enough to appreciate basic \nsystems principles, as expressed in the laws of the fifth discipline \n(Chapter 4) or as revealed in simulations such as the beer game \n(Chapter 3). It is not even enough to see a particular structure under-\nlying a particular problem (perhaps with the help of a consultant). \nThis can lead to solving a problem, but it will not change the thinking that produced \nthe problem in the first place. For learning organizations, only when \nmanagers start thinking in terms of the systems archetypes, does \nsystems thinking become an active daily agent, continually revealing \nhow we create our reality. \nThe purpose of the systems archetypes is to recondition our per-\nceptions, so as to be more able to see structures at play, and to see the \nleverage in those structures. Once a systems archetype is identified, it \nwill always suggest areas of high- and low-leverage change. Presently, \nresearchers have identified about a dozen systems archetypes, nine of \nwhich are presented and used in this book (Appendix 2 contains a \nsummary of the archetypes used here).

For example, organiza-\ntions grow for a while, but then stop growing. Working groups get \nbetter for a while, but stop getting better. Individuals improve them-\nselves for a period of time, then plateau.  \nMany sudden but well-intentione d efforts for improvement bump \nup against limits to growth. A farm er increases his yield by adding \nfertilizer, until the crop grows larger than the rainfall of the region can \nsustain. A crash diet works at first to shave off a few pounds of fat, \nbut then the dieter loses his or he r resolve. We might \"solve\" sudden \ndeadline pressures by working longer hours; eventually, however, the \nadded stress and fatigue slow down our work speed and quality, \ncompensating for the longer hours.  \nPeople who try to break a bad habit such as criticizing others \nfrequently come up against limits to  growth. At first, their efforts to \nstop criticizing pay off. They criticize less. The people around them \nfeel more supported. The others reciprocate with positive feelings, \nwhich makes the person feel better and criticize less. This is a rein-\nforcing spiral of improved behavior, positive feelings, and further \nimprovement. But, then, their resolve weakens. Perhaps they \nstart to find themselves facing the aspects in others' behavior that \nreally gives them the most trouble: it was easy to overlook a few little \nthings, but this is another matter. Perhaps, they just become \ncomplacent and stop paying as close attention to their knee-jerk \ncriticisms. For whatever reason, before long, they are back to their old \nhabits.  \nOnce, in one of our seminars, a participant said, \"Why, that's just \nlike falling in love.\" Cautiously, I asked, \"How so?\" She re-\nsponded, \"Well, first, you meet. You spend a little time together and it's \nwonderful. So you spend more time together. And it's more \nwonderful. Before long, you're spending all your free time together. \nThen you get to know each other better. He doesn't always open the \ndoor for you, or isn't willing to give up bowling with his buddies\u2014 \nevery other night. He discovers that you have a jealous streak, or a bad \ntemper, or aren't very neat. Whatev er it is, you start to see each \nother's shortcomings.\" As you learn each other's flaws, she re-\nminded the rest of us, the dramatic growth in feelings comes to a \nsudden halt\u2014and may even reverse itself, so that you feel worse \nabout each other than you did when you first met.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2590, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0800e679-7f69-4606-92c2-d0d3517769e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "0800e679-7f69-4606-92c2-d0d3517769e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

Thus, the more likely they are to hedge those risks by sticking to \ntraditional practices of multiple suppliers and multiple customers, \nthereby undermining the trust a JIT system requires.6 \nHOW TO ACHIEVE LEVERAGE  \nTypically, most people react to limits to growth situations by trying to \npush hard: if you can't break your bad habit, become more diligent in \nmonitoring your own behavior; if your relationship is having problems, \nspend more time together or work harder to make the relationship \nwork; if staff are unhappy, keep pr omoting junior staff to make them \nhappy; if the flow of new products is slowing down, start more new \nproduct initiatives to offset the prob lems with the ones that are bogged \ndown; or advocate quality circle more strongly.  \nIt's an understandable response. In the early stages when you can \nsee improvement, you want to do mo re of the same\u2014after all, it's \nworking so well. When the rate of improvement slows down, you \nwant to compensate by striving even harder. Unfortunately, the \nmore vigorously you push the familiar levers, the more strongly the \nbalancing process resists, and the more futile your  efforts become. \nSometimes, people just give up thei r original goal\u2014lowering their goal \nto stop criticizing others, or giving up on their relationship, or giving \nup on quality circle or JIT improvements.  \nBut there is another way to deal with limits to growth situations. In \neach of them, leverage lies in the balancing loop \u2014not the reinforcing loop. To \nchange the behavior of the system, you must identify and change the limiting \nfactor. This may require actions you may not yet have considered, \nchoices you never noticed, or difficult changes in rewards and norms. \nTo reach your desired weight may be impossible by dieting alone\u2014you \nneed to speed up the body's metabolic rate, which may require aerobic \nexercise. Sustaining loving relationships requires giving up the ideal of \nthe \"perfect partner\"\u2014 the implicit  goal that limits the continued \nimprovement of any relationship. Maintaining morale and productivity \nas a professional firm matures re quires a different set of norms and \nrewards that salute work well done, not a person's place in the \nhierarchy.

Some firms do this by decentralizing, some by bringing in \nprofessionals skilled in managing creative engineers (which is not easy), \nand some by management development for engineers who want to \nmanage.  \nNot surprisingly, where quality circles have succeeded they have \nbeen part of a broader change in managerial-employee relationships. In \nparticular, successes have involved genuine efforts to redistribute \ncontrol, thereby dealing with the union and management concerns \nover loss of control. Likewise, successful Just in Time systems have \ntaken root as part of \"Total Quality\" programs that focus on meeting \ncustomer needs, stabilizing production rates, and sharing benefits \nwith valued suppliers. These changes were necessary to overcome the \ndistrust that lay behind traditio nal goals of maintaining multiple \nsources of supply and multiple customers. In successful cases, man-\nagers had to ignore temptations to think that quality circle failures \nwere due to individual troublemakers; or that JIT problems came \nfrom a recalcitrant supplier.7 \nBut there is another lesson from the limits to growth structure as \nwell. There will always be more limiting processes. When one source of \nlimitation is removed or made weaker, growth returns until a new \nsource of limitation is encountered. In some settings, like the growth of \na biological population, the fundamental lesson is that growth \neventually will stop. Efforts to extend the growth by removing limits can \nactually be counterproductive, forestalling the eventual day of \nreckoning, which given the pace of change that reinforcing processes \ncan create (remember the French lily pads) may be sooner than we \nthink.  \nHOW TO CREATE YOUR OWN \n\"LIMITS TO GROWTH\" STORY  \nThe best way to understand an archetype is to diagram your \nown version of it.

They come into play when there are obvious \n\"symptoms of problems\" that cry out for attention, and quick and \nready \"fixes\" that can make these symptoms go away, at least for a \nwhile.  \nConsider the problem of stress that comes when our personal \nworkload increases beyond our capabilities to deal with it effectively. \nWe juggle work, family, and community in a never-ending blur of \nactivity. If the workload increases beyond our capacity (which tends \nto happen for us all) the only fundamental solution is to limit the \nworkload. This can be tough\u2014it may mean passing up a promotion \nthat will entail more travel. Or it may mean declining a position on the \nlocal school board. It means prioriti zing and making choices. Instead, \npeople are often tempted to juggle faster, relieving the stress with \nalcohol, drugs, or a more benign form of \"stress reduction\" (such as \nexercise or meditation). But, of course, drinking doesn't really solve \nthe problem of overwork\u2014it only masks the problem by temporarily \nrelieving the stress. The problem comes back, and so does the need \nfor drinking. Insidiously, the shifti ng the burden structure, if not \ninterrupted, generates forces that are all-too-familiar in contemporary \nsociety. These are the dynamics of avoidance, the result of which is \nincreasing dependency, and ultimately addiction.  \nA shifting the burden structure lurks behind many \"solutions\" \nwhich seem to work effectively, but nonetheless leave you with an \nuneasy feeling that they haven't quite taken care of the problem. \nManagers may believe in delegating work to subordinates but still rely \ntoo much on their own ability to step in and \"handle things\" at the \nfirst sign of difficulty, so that the subordinate never gets the necessary \nexperience to do the job. Businesse s losing market share to foreign \ncompetitors may seek tariff protecti on and find themselves unable to \noperate without it. A Third World nation, unable to face difficult \nchoices in limiting government expenditures in line with its tax \nrevenues, finds itself generating de ficits that are \"financed\" through \nprinting money and inflation. Over ti me, inflation becomes a way of life, \nmore and more government assistance is needed, and chronic deficits \nbecome accepted as inevitable.

But easing a \nproblem symptom also reduces any perceived need to find more \nfundamental solutions. Meanwhile, the underlying problem remains \nunaddressed and may worsen, and the side effects of the symptomatic \nsolution make it still harder to apply the fundamental solution. Over \ntime, people rely more and more on the symptomatic solution, which is \nbecoming increasingly the only solution. Without anyone making a \nconscious decision, peopl e have \"shifted the burden\" to increasing \nreliance on symptomatic solutions.  \nInteractions between corporate staff and line managers are fraught \nwith shifting the burden structures . For example, busy managers are \noften tempted to bring in human resource specialists to sort out \npersonnel problems. The HR expert may solve the problem, but the \nmanager's ability to solve other related problems has not improved. \nEventually, other personnel issues will arise and the manager will be just \nas dependent on the HR expert as before. The very fact that the \noutside expert was used successfully before makes it even easier to \nturn to the expert again. \"We had a new batch of difficulties, so we \nbrought in the personnel specialists again. They are getting to know our \npeople and our situation well, so they are very efficient.\" Over time, \nHR experts become increasingly in demand, staff costs soar, and \nmanagers' development (and respect) declines.  \nShifting the burden structures often underlie unintended drifts in \nstrategic direction and erosion in competitive position. A recent \ngroup of executives in a high-tech firm were deeply concerned that \ntheir company was \"losing its edge\" by not bringing dramatic new \nproducts to market. It was less risky to improve existing products. \nHowever, they feared that a cultur e of \"incrementalism\" rather than \n\"breakthrough\" was being fostered. The safer, more predictable, \neasier-to-plan-for-and-organize proc esses of improvement innovation \nwere becoming so entrenched that the managers wondered if the \ncompany was still capable of basic innovation.  \nAs I listened, I recalled a similar strategic drift described by managers \nof a leading consumer goods producer, which had become", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2584, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5bbc8edf-6bd2-4ef8-8a13-c4e5c683b60a": {"__data__": {"id_": "5bbc8edf-6bd2-4ef8-8a13-c4e5c683b60a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

Whenever business sagged for one of its many products, the \ntendency was to run a new advertising promotion. The advertising \nculture had become so entrenched, that the last three CEOs were all \nex-advertising executives, who freq uently wrote ad copy personally. \nMeanwhile, the flow of major new products had dwindled to a trickle \nunder their leadership.  \nA special case of shifting the bu rden, which recurs with alarming \nfrequency, is \"eroding goals.\" Whenever there is a gap between our \ngoals and our current situation there are two sets of pressures: to \nimprove the situation and to lower our goals. How these pressures \nare dealt with is central to the discipline of personal mastery, as will be \nshown in Chapter 9.  \nSocieties collude in eroding goals all the time: witness the lowered \nstandards for \"full employment\" in th e United States. The federal full-\nemployment target slid from 4 percent in the 1960s to 6 to 7 percent \nby the early 1980s. (In other words, we were willing to tolerate 50 to \n75 percent more unemployment as \"natural.\") Likewise, 3 to 4 \npercent inflation was considered severe in the early 1960s, but a \nvictory for anti-inflation policies by the early 1980s. In  1984, the U.S. \nCongress passed the \"Gramm-Rudman-Hollings\" deficit reduction bill. \nThe original bill called for reaching a balanced budget by 1991. Shortly \nthereafter, it was clear that the budget reduction was not proceeding \non pace, so the target was shifted to 1993. This eroding goal structure \ncan be diagrammed as follows:  \nAs we will see in the next two chapters, similar eroding goal dy-\nnamics play out in organizations around goals for quality, goals for \ninnovation, goals for personal growth of employees, and goals for \norganizational improvement. In effect, we all can become \"addicted\" \nto lowering our goals.

To trace out the causes of the reinforcing cycle, \njust imagine you are moving around the \"figure eight\" created by the \ntwo interacting feedback processes: stress builds, which leads to more \nalcohol, which relieves stress, which leads to less perceived need to \nadjust workload, which leads to more workload, which leads to more \nstress.  \nThese are the generic dynamics of addiction. In fact, almost all \nforms of addiction have shifting the burden structures underlying \nthem. All involve opting for symptomatic solutions, the gradual atrophy \nof the ability to focus on fundamen tal solutions, and the increasing \nreliance on symptomatic solutions. By this definition, \norganizations and entire societies are subject to addiction as much as \nare individuals.  \nShifting the burden structures tend to produce periodic crises, \nwhen the symptoms of stress surface.  The crises are usually resolved \nwith more of the symptomatic solution, causing the symptoms to \ntemporarily improve. What is often less evident is a slow, long-term \ndrift to lower levels of health: financial health for the corporation or \nphysical health for the individual.

Without a \nvision of succeeding through new product innovation, pressures to \ndivert investment into short-term problem-solving will be over-\nwhelming.

Until they deal credibly with perceived corruption, they will \nneither be able to raise taxes nor reduce spending.  \nA splendid illustration of the principles of leverage in shifting the \nburden structures can be found in the approach of some of the most \neffective alcoholism and drug treatment programs. They insist that \npeople face their addiction on one hand, while offering support \ngroups and training to help them rehabilitate on the other.

First, there's a problem that gets gradually worse \nover the long term\u2014although every so often it seems to get \nbetter for a while. Second, the overall health of the system \ngradually worsens. Third, ther e's a growing feeling of help-\nlessness. People start out fe eling euphoric\u2014they've solved \ntheir problem!\u2014but end up feeling as if they are victims.  \nIn particular, look for situations of dependency, in which \nyou have a sense that the real issues, the deeper issues, are \nnever quite dealt with effectively. Again, once you have such a \nsituation in mind, see if you can identify the appropriate \nelements of the reinforc ing and balancing loops.  \n \nStart by identifying the \"problem  symptom.\" This will be the \n\"squeaky wheel\" that demands attention\u2014such as stress, \nsubordinates' inabilities to solve pressing problems, falling \nmarket share. Then identify a \"fundamental solution\" (there \nmay be more than one)\u2014a course of action that would, you \nbelieve, lead to enduring improv ement. Then, id entify one or \nseveral \"symptomatic solutions\" that might ameliorate symp-\ntoms for a time.  \nIn fact, \"fundamental solutions\" and \"symptomatic solu-\ntions\" are relative terms, and what is most valuable is recog-  \nnizing the multiple ways in which a problem can be addressed, \nfrom the most fundamental to the most superficial.  \nThen identify the possible negative \"side effects\" of the \nsymptomatic solution.  \nThe primary insights in shifting  the burden will come from \n(1) distinguishing different types of solutions; (2) seeing how \nreliance on symptomatic solutions can reinforce further reli-\nance. The leverage will always in volve strengthening the bottom \ncircle, and/or weakening the top circle. Just as with limits to \ngrowth, it's best to test your  conclusions here with small \nactions\u2014and to give the tests time to come to fruition.

In fact, the following case is a mosaic pieced together from \nseveral specific instances where the same story unfolded.1 \nWHEN   WE   CREATE   OUR   OWN \n\"MARKET   LIMITATIONS\" \nIn the mid-1960s a new electronics company was founded with a \nunique high-tech product\u2014a new ty pe of computer. Thanks to its \nengineering know-how, WonderTech had a virtual lock on its market \nniche. There was enormous demand for its products, and there were \nenough investors to guarantee no financial constraints. \nYet the company, which began wi th meteoric growth, never sus-\ntained its rapid growth after its first three years. Eventually it declined \ninto bankruptcy. \nThat fate would have seemed unthinkable during WonderTech's \nfirst three years, when sales doubled annually. In fact, sales were so \ngood that backlogs of orders began to pile up midway through their \nsecond year. Even with steadily increasing manufacturing capacity \n(more factories, more shifts, more advanced technology), the demand \ngrew so fast that delivery times slipped a bit. Originally they had \npromised to deliver machines within eight weeks, and they intended \nto return to that standard; but with some pride, the top management \ntold investors, \"Our computers are so good that some customers \nare willing to wait fourteen weeks for them. We know it's a problem, \nand we're working to fix it, but nonetheless they're still glad to get the \nmachines, and they love 'em when they get 'em.\" \nThe top management knew that they had to add production capacity. \nAfter six months of study, while manufacturing changed from a one-\nshift to a two-shift operation, they decided to borrow the money to \nbuild a new factory. To make sure the growth kept up, they \npumped much of the incoming revenue directly back into sales and \nmarketing. Since the company sold its products only through a direct \nsales force, that meant hiring and tr aining more sales people. During the \ncompany's third year, the sales force doubled. \nBut despite this, sales started to slump at the end of the third year.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2154, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a934877b-3c3e-4b3c-b4de-54473106ed77": {"__data__": {"id_": "a934877b-3c3e-4b3c-b4de-54473106ed77", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

It was as if everyone in the company \nsimultaneously turned and looked at one person: the marketing and \nsales vice president.  \nNot surprisingly, the marketing and sales VP had become a rising \nstar in the company. His force had done so well during the initial \nboom that he had anticipated a promotion. Now there was a slump, \nand he was under heat to turn sales around. So he took the most \nlikely course of action. He held high-powered sales meetings with a \nsingle message: \"Sell! Sell! Sell!\" He fired the low performers. He \nincreased sales incentives, added special discounts, and ran new \nadvertising promotions describing the machine in an exciting new way.  \nAnd indeed, sales rose again. Th e sales and marketing VP found \nhimself once more hailed as a hero, a born-again motivator who \ncould take charge of a tough situat ion. Once again, WonderTech was in \nthe happy position of having rapidly rising orders. Eventually, backlogs \nbegan to grow again. And after a year, delivery times began to rise \nagain\u2014first to ten weeks, then to twelve, and eventually to sixteen. \nThe debate over adding capacity started anew. But this time, having \nbeen stung on the last occasion, the top management was still more \ncautious. Eventually, approval of a new facility was granted, but no \nsooner had the papers been signed than a new sales crisis started.

But that's exactly what Wonder-\nTech's managers did. They tried to reignite the \"engine of growth\" \nthrough sales incentives, marketing pr omotions, and minor product \nimprovements\u2014none of which had any leverage. The leverage \nwould lie with the balancing process.  \nWhy wasn't that balancing process noticed? First, WonderTech's \nfinancially oriented top management did not pay much attention to \ntheir delivery service. They mainly tracked sales, profits, return on \ninvestment, and market share. So long as these were healthy, delivery \ntimes were the least of their concerns. When financial performance \nweakened, pressures shifted to boost orders. Usually, by this time, \ndelivery times were already starting to come down because orders \nwere falling. Thus, whether times we re good, or times were bad, the \ntop management paid little attention to the time customers had to wait \nto get their computers.  \nEven if they had, they would not necessarily have seen delivery time \nas a key factor affecting sales. Delivery times had been getting longer \nand longer, for more than a year and a half, before the first sales crisis \nhit. This reinforced an attitude among top management: \"Customers \ndon't care about late shipments.\" But that complacency was \nmisplaced; customers were concerned, but their concern was obscured, \nto WonderTech's management, by a built-in delay in the system. A \ncustomer would say, \"I want the machine delivered in eight weeks.\" \nThe salesperson would say fine. But after nine, ten, or twelve weeks, \nthere would still be no machine. After several more months, gossip \nwould filter out. However, the nu mber of potential customers was \nvast. And the gossip had little effect  until it eventually mushroomed \ninto a widespread reputation for poor deliveries. In the chart above, \nthis delay falls in the arrow between Delivery Time and Sales \nDifficulty.  \nWonderTech's managers had fallen prey to the classic learning \ndisability of being unable to detect cause and effect which were \nseparated in time. In general, if you wait until demand falls off, and then \nget concerned about delivery time, it's way too late. The slow delivery \ntime has already begun to correct itself\u2014temporarily. At WonderTech, \ndelivery times grew worse during the third year, the last year of rapid \ngrowth. Then they improved during  the downturn that followed; but \nthen they grew worse again.  \nOver the entire ten-year history of the firm, there was an unfortu-\nnate trend of rising delivery times, interrupted by periodic improve-", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2674, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c543a3c-d33a-4cd3-841d-6b25778b3092": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c543a3c-d33a-4cd3-841d-6b25778b3092", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

That meant that new capacity \ntook longer and longer to come on-line\u2014or never came on-line at all. \nBy the time WonderTech's manage rs were finally ready to add \ncapacity, the symptomatic response had already relieved the pressure, \nand delivery times had started to fall. Thus their long-term plan for \nbuilding capacity apparently failed them each time. \"Let's wait a little \nlonger before building,\" they said , \"to make sure the demand is \nthere.\"  \nIn effect, there was a horserace going on between the two re-\nsponses. Over time, the symptomatic response became more rapid, \nwhile the fundamental response became more sluggish. The net \neffect was that gradually the \"d isgruntled customer\" response \nassumed more and more of the burden for controlling delivery \ntimes.  \nAs delivery times steadily worsened, WonderTech's customer \nbase evolved toward customers who were less sensitive to poor de-\nlivery service. That meant they were more sensitive to price. Such \ncustomers are less loyal and easily lured away by competitors offering \nlower prices. WonderTech was drifting  into the vulnerable position of \nbeing a low-quality, low-price supplier, in a market which they had \npioneered.  \nWonderTech's fate could have been reversed. There was a point of \nleverage in the structure: the firms' original commitment to an eight-\nweek delivery time. In the shifting  the burden structure, the first \nthing a systems thinker looks for is what might be weakening the \nfundamental response. In this case, the firm had a delivery time \nstandard \u2014eight weeks\u2014that obviously n ever meant a great deal to the \nfinancially preoccupied top managers.  \nAfter three years, the actual operating standard to which manufac-\nturing had become accustomed was about ten weeks. Over time, as \ndelivery problems returned, the stan dard continued to drift. No one \nthought much about it, least of all top management.

If standards are allowed to drift, the \nfirm's response is weakened and \"the burden shifts\" to the \ndisgruntled customers. In other words, the company unwittingly \nbecomes addicted to the limiting of its own growth.  \nCHOOSING     BETWEEN  \nSELF-LIMITING     O R  SELF-\nSUSTAINING     GROWTH  \nThe systemic structure underlying WonderTech explains many complex \nsituations where companies that we re once growing rapidly and were \nhighly successful fail mysteriously. In fact, this structure is another \nsystems archetype called growth and underinvestment, a bit more \ncomplicated than the two previous archetypes. This archetype operates \nwhenever a company limits its own growth through underinvestment. \nUnderinvestment means building less capacity than is really needed to \nserve rising customer demand. You can recognize growth and \nunderinvestment by the failure of a firm to achieve its potential \ngrowth despite everyone's working tremendously hard (a sign of the \nunderinvestment). Usually, there is continuing financial stress\u2014which, \nironically, is both cause and consequence of underinvestment. \nFinancial stress makes aggressive investment difficult or impossible, but \nthe financial stress today originates in the underinvestment of the past. \nIf you look closely, you will also see eroding or declining standards, \nwithin the company or in dustry, for \"quality.\" (By quality we mean all \nthe things that matter to a customer, such as product quality, service \nquality, and delivery reliability). Standards erode, or fail to continually \nadvance with competition, which re sults in a failure to invest in \nbuilding capacity to serve customer needs. (\"Investing\" may mean \nadding or improving physical capacity, training personnel, improving \nwork processes, or improving orga nizational structures.) Disgruntled \ncustomers then go elsewhere. Or, if there is no elsewhere, as in the \ncase of eroding standards in an entire industry, customers stop asking \nfor what they can't have. Reduced customer demand eliminates the \nsymptoms of unmet demand. It also reduces financial resources to \ninvest in more capacity.  \nIf all this happened in a month, the whole organization or industry \nwould be mobilized to prevent it.

This is the structure that underlies the \"boiled frog\" \nsyndrome discussed in the learning disabilities of Chapter 2. The \nfrog's standards for water temperature steadily erode, and its capacity \nto respond to the threat of boiling atrophies.  \nFor a single firm such as WonderTech, the result is a slow, steady \ndecline in market share and profitability. For an entire industry, the \nresult is increasing vulnerability to foreign competitors with higher \nstandards, happening so slowly that it's difficult to detect, often \nmasked by \"shifting the burden\" pa lliatives such as increased adver-\ntising, discounting, \"restructuring,\" or lobbying for tariff protection. In \nmy opinion, the dynamics of eroding goals and underinvestment lie at \nthe heart of the demise, between the mid-1960s and mid-1980s, of \nmany American manufacturing industries, such as steel autos, machine \ntools, and consumer electronics. In each of these industries, loss of \nmarket share to foreign competitors, which was invariably blamed on \nexternal factors, had its origins, at least in part, in weak standards for \ncustomer satisfaction, underinvestment, and unhappy customers.  \nThere are many examples of growth and underinvestment in service \nindustries as well. Schools which let the quality of their courses slip, \nuntil they lose accreditation. Hospitals whose reputation for patient \ncare erodes as old facilities are not upgraded and the staff becomes \nincreasingly overworked. Radio and television stations that cut their \nreporting budgets and let \"happy talk\" substitute for in-depth news \ncoverage. One such prominent industry example will be examined in \nthe next chapter\u2014the case of People Express Airlines.  \nWhen understood, the growth an d underinvestment structure can \nbe a powerful guide for a company trying to create its own future. Jay \nForrester tells an intere sting story from the early days of the Digital \nEquipment Corporation. The company started operations in a corner \nof one floor of an old mill building outside Boston, with about a \ndozen employees. As a member of Digital's Board of Directors (Digital \nwas founded by several of Forrester's former MIT graduate students), \nForrester later persuaded the board to rent the whole football-field-\nsized floor as soon as the space became available. But that leap in \ncapacity, which seemed outrageous at first, allowed Digital to grow \nwithout eroding its standards. A most dramatic experience, Forrester \nsaid later, was to come back only six months later and find the entire \nfloor full of people, productively employed.

In \neffect, the art of systems thinking lies in seeing through complexity to \nthe underlying structures generating change. Systems thinking does \nnot mean ignoring complexity. Rather, it means organizing complexity \ninto a coherent story that illuminates the causes of problems and how \nthey can be remedied in enduring ways. The increasing complexity of \ntoday's world leads many managers  to assume that they lack \ninformation they need to act effectively. I would suggest that the \nfundamental \"information problem\" faced by managers is not too \nlittle information but too much information.

Along the way, \nPeople Express established a reputation as a corporate pioneer, \ncrafting a stirring corporate philosophy articulated by charismatic \nfounder Don Burr. \"Most organizations believe that humans are \ngenerally bad and you have to control them and watch them,\" said \nBurr in one typical statement. \"At People Express, people are trusted \nto do a good job until they prove they definitely won't . . .\"3 The airline \ntranslated that philosophy into a host of innovative human resource \npolicies that have since been adopted by many other firms, such as job \nrotation, team management, universal stock ownership, and only four \nlevels of hierarchy (with only four pay levels in the whole company). \nYet, despite its spectacular early success, in September 1986 People \nExpress was taken over by Texas Air Corporation, having lost $133 \nmillion in the first six months of 1986 alone.

Its stock was \ntrading at $22 a share, up from $8.50 at startup. Despite being over-\nworked, many of People's employees were growing wealthy. Burr \npreached the merits of hard work in the pursuit of a lofty vision: \n\"People get more fatigued and stressed when they don't have a lot to \ndo. I really believe that, and I think I have tested it. . . .  It's \nsensational what direction can do. The beauty of the human condition \nis the magic people are capable of when there's direction. When there's \nno direction, you're not capable of much.\" Revenues doubled again \nin 1984, although profits did not rise proportionately.  \nMeanwhile, People Express's customers were complaining more \nabout service problems. There were more and more ticketing and \nreservation delays, and canceled or overbooked flights. On-board \nflight attendants became less friendly and less efficient. Customers \nforgave all this at first, and kept returning to the airline. Thus, there \nwas no apparent penalty for poor service.

Falling to maintain service quality made price its only com-\npetitive advantage, which in turn made it vulnerable.  \nAt MIT, John Sterman has created a computer-based \"micro-\nworld\" of the People Express case history called the \"People Express \nFlight Simulator.\" At the beginning of the school year, all incoming \nmaster's degree students in the Management School get to try their \nhand at seeing how well they might have done at the reins of People \nExpress. As a learning tool, the flight simulator lets students try a \nwide range of policies and strategies in an attempt to exploit People \nExpress's initial advantage in cost  and market position. They try \nmarketing promotions and price cuts. They try hiring more service \npersonnel and less service personnel. They try not expanding the fleet \nso rapidly (e.g., not buying Frontier Airlines) and they try expanding \nmore rapidly. They try redefining the \"scope\" of People's services to \ninclude more or fewer services for the basic fare. As they come to \nunderstand the growth and unde rinvestment dynamics, they come \naround to strategies that succeed in  sustaining growth in revenues and \nprofits, maintaining high service quality, and expanding service capacity \nat a pace in balance with passengers carried. The key is strengthening \nthe \"fundamental solution\" of building service capacity. This is best \ndone by limiting demand growth and by a commitment to service \nquality. Both objectives can be achieved through simple changes, \nespecially through:  \n\u2022 25 percent higher fares (still two thirds of average industry fares) \n\u2022 Sustained, high service standards \nThough simple, these high-leverage changes represent a shift in \nbasic strategy. Sustained high service standards create a commitment \nto service quality as a competitive advantage. Many have suggested that \nPeople grew too fast, but the leverage lies in pricing somewhat higher, \nboth to slow down growth and to increase profits to invest in building \nservice capacity. Slightly higher prices would have left People Express \nwith more room to maneuver (say by temporarily lowering price) \nwhen competitors started to chip away at the firm's price advantage. \n(In the simulator\u2014even with a sharp drop in competitor fares, as \noccurred when computerized reserv ation systems were introduced\u2014\nPeople Express still remains successful with the above strategy.)  \nIn the end, People Express's executives' belief that the enemy \nwas \"out there\" kept them from seeing the contradictions in their", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2624, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0eb5bda3-0f46-4292-8688-048ec92cf5a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "0eb5bda3-0f46-4292-8688-048ec92cf5a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "122", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

It goes beyond spiritual unfolding \nor opening, although it requires spiritual growth. It means approaching \none's life as a creative work, living life from a creative as opposed to \nreactive viewpoint. As my long-time colleague Robert Fritz puts it:  \nThroughout history, almost every culture has had art, music, \ndance, architecture, poetry, storytelling, pottery, and sculpture. The \ndesire to create is not limited by beliefs, nationality, creed, \neducational background, or era. The ur ge resides in all of us . . .

The \nfirst is continually clarifying what is important to us. We often spend too \nmuch time coping with problems along our path that we forget why \nwe are on that path, in the first place. The result is that we only have a \ndim, or even inaccurate, view of what's really important to us.  \nThe second is continually learning how to see current reality more \nclearly.

They have a special sense of purpose that lies behind \ntheir visions and goals. For such a person, a vision is a calling rather than simply \na good idea. They see \"current reality\" as an ally, not an enemy. They \nhave learned how to perceive and work with forces of change rather \nthan resist those forces. They are deeply inquisitive, committed to \ncontinually seeing reality more and more accurately. They feel \nconnected to others and to life itself. Yet they sacrifice none of their \nuniqueness. They feel as if they are part of a larger creative process, \nwhich they can influence but cannot unilaterally control.  \nPeople with a high level of personal mastery live in a continual \nlearning mode. They never \"arrive.\" Sometimes, language, such as the \nterm \"personal mastery,\" creates a misleading sense of definite-ness, of \nblack and white. But personal mastery is not something you possess. It \nis a process. It is a lifelong disc ipline. People with a high level of \npersonal mastery are acutely aw are of their ignorance, their \nincompetence, their growth areas. And they are deeply self-confident. \nParadoxical?

No one will ever be able to \nmeasure to three decimal places how much personal mastery con-\ntributes to productivity and the bottom line. In a materialistic culture \nsuch as ours, it is difficult even to discuss some of the premises of \npersonal mastery. \"Why do people need to talk about this stuff?\" \nsomeone may ask. \"Isn't it obvious? Don't we already know it?\"  \nA more daunting form of resistance is cynicism. The human potential \nmovement, and along with it much of \"humanistic management,\" \noverpromised itself to corporations during the 1970s and 1980s. It \nprompted executives to idealize each  other and expect grand, instant, \nhuman character transformations, which can never happen.  \nIn combating cynicism, it helps to know its source. Scratch the \nsurface of most cynics and you find a frustrated idealist\u2014someone \nwho made the mistake of converting his ideals into expectations. For \nexample, many of those cynical about personal mastery once held \nhigh ideals about people. Then they found themselves disappointed, \nhurt, and eventually embittered because people fell short of their \nideals. Hanover's Bill O'Brien points out that \"burnout\" comes \nfrom causes other than simply working too hard. \"There are teachers, \nsocial workers, and cler gy,\" says O'Brien, \"who work incredibly hard \nuntil they are 80 years old and never suffer \"burnout\"\u2014 because they \nhave an accurate view of human nature. They don't over-romanticize \npeople, so they don't feel the great psychological stress when people \nlet them down.\"  \nFinally, some fear that personal mastery will threaten the established \norder of a well-managed company. This is a valid fear. To empower people \nin an unaligned organization can be counterproductive. If people do not share \na common vision, and do not share common \"mental models\" about \nthe business reality within which they operate, empowering people \nwill only increase organizational stress and the burden of management \nto maintain coherence and direction. This is why the discipline of \npersonal mastery must always be seen as one among the set of \ndisciplines of a learning organization. An organizational commitment to \npersonal mastery would be naive and foolish if leaders in the \norganization lacked the capabilities of building shared vision and shared \nmental models to guide local decision makers.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2413, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f375516b-a44c-476c-bd40-4fee25542b55": {"__data__": {"id_": "f375516b-a44c-476c-bd40-4fee25542b55", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "132", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

Just as one becomes a master artist by continual \npractice, so the following principles and practices lay the groundwork \nfor continually expanding personal mastery.  \nPERSONAL VISION  \nPersonal vision comes from within. Several years ago I was talking with \na young woman about her vision for the planet. She said many lovely \nthings about peace and harmony, about living in balance with nature. As \nbeautiful as these ideas were, she spoke about them unemotionally, as \nif these were things that she should want. I asked her if there was \nanything else. After a pause, she said, \"I want to live on a green \nplanet,\" and started to cry. As far as I know, she had never said this \nbefore. The words just leaped from her, almost with a will of their \nown. Yet, the image they conveyed clearly had deep meaning to her\u2014\nperhaps even levels of meanin g that she didn't understand.  \nMost adults have little sense of real vision. We have goals and \nobjectives, but these are not visions. When asked what they want, many \nadults will say what they want to get rid of. They'd like a better job\u2014\nthat is, they'd like to get rid of the boring job they have. They'd like to \nlive in a better neighborhood, or not have to worry about crime, or \nabout putting their kids through school. They'd like it if their mother-\nin-law returned to her own house, or if their back stopped hurting. Such \nlitanies of \"negative visions\" are sadly commonplace, even among very \nsuccessful people. They are the byproduct of a lifetime of fitting in, of \ncoping, of problem solving. As a teenager in one of our programs once \nsaid, \"We shouldn't call them 'grown ups' we should call them 'given \nups.' \"  \nA subtler form of diminished vision is \"focusing on the means not \nthe result.\" Many senior executives, for example, choose \"high \nmarket share\" as part of their vision. But why? \"Because I want our \ncompany to be profitable.\" Now, you might think that high profits is an \nintrinsic result in and of itself, and indeed it is for some.

Why choose high annual profits? \"Because I \nwant us to remain an independent company, to keep from being taken \nover.\" Why do you want that? \"Becau se I want to keep our integrity \nand our capacity to be true to our purpose in starting the \norganization.\" While all the goals mentioned are legitimate, the last\u2014\nbeing true to our purpose\u2014has the greatest intrinsic significance to \nthis executive. All the rest are me ans to the end, means which might \nchange in particular circumstances. The ability to focus on ultimate intrinsic \ndesires, not only on seco ndary goals, is a cornerstone of personal mastery.  \nReal vision cannot be understood in isolation from the idea of \npurpose. By purpose, I mean an individual's sense of why he is alive. No \none could prove or disprove the st atement that human beings have \npurpose. It would be fruitless even to engage in the debate. But as a \nworking premise, the idea has great power. One implication is that \nhappiness may be most directly a result of living consistently with \nyour purpose. George Bernard Shaw expressed the idea pointedly \nwhen he said:  \nThis is the true joy in life, the be ing used for a purpose recognized by \nyourself as a mighty one . . . the being a force of nature instead of \na feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining \nthat the world will not devote itself to making you happy.7 \nThis same principle has been expressed in some organizations as \n\"genuine caring.\" In places where people felt uncomfortable talking \nabout personal purpose, they felt perfectly at ease talking about \ngenuine caring. When people genu inely care, they are naturally com-\nmitted. They are doing what they tr uly want to do. They are full of \nenergy and enthusiasm. They persevere,  even in the face of frustration \nand setbacks, because what they are doing is what they must do. It is \ntheir work.  \nEveryone has had experiences when work flows fluidly; when he \nfeels in tune with a task and works with a true economy of means. \nSomeone whose vision calls him to a foreign country, for example, may \nfind himself learning a new language far more rapidly than he ever \ncould before. You can often recogniz e your personal vision because it \ncreates such moments; it is the goal pulling you forward that makes all \nthe work worthwhile.  \nBut vision is different from purpose.

Vision is a specific destination, a picture of a \ndesired future. Purpose is abstract. Vision is concrete. Purpose is \n\"advancing man's capability to explore the heavens.\" Vision is \"a \nman on the moon by the end of the 1960s.\" Purpose is \"being the \nbest I can be,\" \"excellence.\" Vision is breaking four minutes in the \nmile. \nIt can truly be said that nothing happens until there is vision. But it \nis equally true that a vision with no underlying sense of purpose, no \ncalling, is just a good idea\u2014all \"sound and fury, signifying nothing.\"  \nConversely, purpose without vision has no sense of appropriate \nscale. As O'Brien says, \"You and I may be tennis fans and enjoy \ntalking about ground strokes, our backhands, the thrill of chasing \ndown a corner shot, of hitting a winner. We may have a great con-\nversation, but then we find out that  I am gearing up to play at my \nlocal country club and you are preparing for Wimbledon. We share the \nsame enthusiasm and love of the game, but at totally different scales \nof proficiency. Until we establish the scales we have in mind, we might \nthink we are communicating when we're not.\"  \nVision often gets confused with competition. You might say, \n\"My vision is to beat the other team.\" And indeed, competition can be \na useful way of calibrating a vision, of setting scale. To beat the \nnumber-ten player at the tennis club is different from beating the \nnumber one. But to be number one of a mediocre lot may not fulfill \nmy sense of purpose. Moreover, what is my vision after I reach \nnumber one?  \nUltimately, vision is intrinsic not relative. It's something you desire \nfor its intrinsic value, not because of where it stands you relative to \nanother. Relative visions may be appropriate in the interim, but they \nwill rarely lead to greatness. Nor is there anything wrong with \ncompetition. Competition is one of the best structures yet invented \nby humankind to allow each of us to bring out the best in each other. \nBut after the competition is over, after the vision has (or has not) \nbeen achieved, it is one's sense of purpose that draws you further, \nthat compels you to set a new vision. This, again, is why personal mastery \nmust be a discipline. It is a process of continually focusing and refocusing on what \none truly wants, on one's visions.  \nVision is multifaceted. There are material facets of our visions, \nsuch as where we want to live and how much money we want to \nhave in the bank. There are personal facets, such as health, freedom, \nand being true to ourselves. There are service facets, such as helping", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2634, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6b81783-6a34-4be3-b2c0-93a51c8b1c5f": {"__data__": {"id_": "b6b81783-6a34-4be3-b2c0-93a51c8b1c5f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "135", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

All are \npart of what we truly want. Modern society tends to direct our atten-\ntion to the material aspects, and si multaneously foster guilt for our \nmaterial desires. Society places  some emphasis on our personal de-\nsires\u2014for example, it is almost a fetish in some circles to look trim \nand fit\u2014and relatively little on our desi res to serve. In fact, it is easy to \nfeel naive or foolish by expressing a desire to make a contribution. Be \nthat as it may, it is clear from working with thousands of people that \npersonal visions span all these dimensions and more. It is also clear \nthat it takes courage to hold visions that are not in the social \nmainstream.  \nBut it is exactly that courage to take a stand for one's vision that \ndistinguishes people with high levels of personal mastery. Or, as the \nJapanese say of the master's stand, \"When there is no break, not \neven the thickness of a hair comes between a man's vision and his \naction.\"8 \nIn some ways, clarifying vision is one of the easier aspects of \npersonal mastery. A more difficul t challenge, for many, comes in \nfacing current reality.  \nHOLDING CREATIVE TENSION  \nPeople often have great difficulty talking about their visions, even \nwhen the visions are clear. Why? Be cause we are acutely aware of the \ngaps between our vision and reality. \"I would like to start my own \ncompany,\" but \"I don't have the capital.\" Or, \"I would like to pursue \nthe profession that I really love,\" but \"I've got to make a living.\" \nThese gaps can make a vision seem unrealistic or fanciful. They can \ndiscourage us or make us feel hopeless. But the gap between vision \nand current reality is also a sour ce of energy. If there was no gap, \nthere would be no need for any ac tion to move toward the vision. \nIndeed, the gap is the source of creative energy. We call this gap creative \ntension.  \nImagine a rubber band, stretched between your vision and current \nreality. When stretched, the rubber band creates tension, representing \nthe tension between vision and current reality. What does tension seek? \nResolution or release. There are only two possible ways for the \ntension to resolve itself: pull reality toward the vision or pull the vision \ntoward reality. Which occurs will de pend on whether we hold steady to \nthe vision.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2375, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6983f1ff-942f-47c6-92c0-751c85b77531": {"__data__": {"id_": "6983f1ff-942f-47c6-92c0-751c85b77531", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

Yet, it is widely \nmisunderstood. For example, the very term \"tension\" suggests anxiety \nor stress. But creative tension doesn't feel any particular way. It is the \nforce that comes into play at the moment when we acknowledge a \nvision that is at odds with current reality.  \nStill, creative tension often leads to  feelings or emotions associated \nwith anxiety, such as sadness, discouragement, hopelessness, or \nworry. This happens so often th at people easily confuse these \nemotions with creative tension. People come to think that the creative \nprocess is all about being in a state of anxiety. But it is important to realize \nthat these \"negative\" emotions that may arise when there is creative \ntension are not creative tension itself . These emotions are what we call \nemotional tension.  \nIf we fail to distingu ish emotional tension from creative tension, we \npredispose ourselves to lowering our vision. If we feel deeply \ndiscouraged about a vision that is not happening, we may have a \nstrong urge to lighten the load of that discouragement. There is one \nimmediate remedy: lower the vision! \"Well, it wasn't really that \nimportant to shoot seventy-five. I'm having a great time shooting in \nthe eighties.\"  \nOr, \"I don't really care about being able  to play in recital. I'll have to \nmake money as a music teacher in any case; I'll just concentrate \nthere.\" The dynamics of relieving emotional tension are insidious \nbecause they can operate unnoticed.

Our goals are now much closer to our current \nreality. Escaping emotional tension is easy\u2014the only price we pay is \nabandoning what we truly want, our vision.  \nThe dynamics of emotional tension deeply resemble the dynamics of \neroding goals that so troubled WonderTech and People Express, in \nChapters 7 and 8. The interaction of creative tension and emotional \ntension is a shifting the burden dynamic, similar to that of eroding \ngoals, that can be represented as follows:  \n \nW h e n  w e  h o l d  a  v i s i o n  t h a t  d i f f e r s  f r o m  c u r r e n t  r e a l i t y ,  a  g a p  \nexists (the creative tension) which can be resolved in two ways. The \nlower balancing process represents the \"fundamental solution\": taking \nactions to bring reality into line wi th the vision. But changing reality \ntakes time. This is what leads to the frustration and emotional tension \nin the upper balancing process, the \"symptomatic solution\" of \nlowering the vision to bring it into line with current reality.  \nBut a onetime reduction in the vision usually isn't the end of the \nstory. Sooner or later new pressures pulling reality away from the \n(new, lowered) vision arise, leading to  still more pressures to lower the \nvision. The classic \"shifting the burden\" dynamic ensues, a subtle \nreinforcing spiral of failure to meet goals, frustration, lowered vision, \ntemporary relief, and pressure anew to lower the vision still further. \nGradually, the \"burden\" is shifting increasingly to lowering the vision.  \nAt WonderTech and People Express relieving emotional tension \ntook the form of decline in key operating standards that seemed \nimpossible to meet\u2014standards for delivery performance and for ser-", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1755, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c50b9b57-2011-4c1b-94f1-7d4dd74a0d64": {"__data__": {"id_": "c50b9b57-2011-4c1b-94f1-7d4dd74a0d64", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "138", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

The decline was especially difficult to see because it \nwas gradual. During each crisis at Wonder Tech delivery standards \neroded just a bit relative to where they had settled after the last \ncrisis. Likewise, managers at People Express didn't wake up one \nmorning and declare, \"We've solved our problems keeping pace \nwith growth, we'll lower our serv ice standards.\" Rather, service \nstandards eroded quietly during repeated crises and with turnover \namong key leaders. So, too, do eroding personal goals go unrecog-\nnized, as we gradually surrender our dreams for the relationships we \nwant to have, the work we want to do, and the type of world we \nwant to live in.  \nIn organizations, goals erode because of low tolerance for emo-\ntional tension. Nobody wants to be the messenger with bad news. \nThe easiest path is to just pretend there is no bad news, or better \nyet, \"declare victory\"\u2014to redefine the bad news as not so bad by \nlowering the standard ag ainst which it is judged.  \nThe dynamics of emotional tension exist at all levels of human \nactivity. They are the dynamics of compromise, the path of mediocrity. \nAs Somerset Maugham said, \"Only medi ocre people are always at their \nbest.\"  \nWe allow our goals to erode when  we are unwilling to live with \nemotional tension. On the other hand, when we understand creative \ntension and allow it to operate by not lowering our vision, vision \nbecomes an active force. Robert Fritz says, \"It's not what the vision is, \nit's what the vision does.\" Truly creative people use the gap between \nvision and current reality to generate energy for change.  \nFor example, Alan Kay, who directed the research at Xerox Palo \nAlto Research Center (PARC) that led to many key features of the \npersonal computer, actually had a vision for a diffe rent machine, \nwhich he called the \"dynabook.\" This would be a book that was \ninteractive. A child could test out his understanding, play games, and \ncreatively rearrange the static presentation of ideas offered by the \ntraditional book. Kay failed, in a sense, because the \"dynabook\" never \nbecame a reality. But the vision reshaped the computer industry. The \nprototype machines developed at PARC achieved the functionality\u2014\nwindows, pull-down menus, mouse control, iconic displays (images \nrather than words)\u2014that was introduced commercially ten years later \nin the Macintosh.  \nBill Russell, the legendary center for the Boston Celtics basketball \nteam, used to keep his own personal scorecard.

Failure is an  opportunity for learning\u2014 about \ninaccurate pictures of cu rrent reality, about strategies that didn't work \nas expected, about the clarity of the vision. Failures are ! not about our \nunworthiness or powerlessness. Ed Land, founder and president of \nPolaroid for decades and inventor of instant photography, had one \nplaque on his wall. It read:  \nA mistake is an event, the full benefit of which has not yet been \nturned to your advantage.  \nMastery of creative tension brings  out a capacity for perseverance \nand patience. A Japanese executive in one of our seminars once told \nme how, in his view, Japanese and Americans have quite different \nattitudes toward time. He said that, \"U.S. businessmen in Japan to \nnegotiate business deals often find the Japanese evasive and reticent to \n'get down to business.' The Amer ican arrives in Japan on a tight, \ncarefully planned five-day schedule and immediately wants to get to \nwork. Instead, the Japanese greet them with a polite, formal tea \nceremony instead, never ge tting down to nuts and bolts. As the days go \nby, the Japanese keep their slow pace, while the Americans become \nantsier and antsier. For the Americ an,\" the executive said, \"time is \nthe enemy. For the Japane se, time is an ally.\"  \nMore broadly, current reality itself is, for many of us, the enemy. We \nfight against what is. We are not so much drawn to what we want to \ncreate as we are repelled by what we have, from our current reality. \nBy this logic, the deeper the fear, the more we abhor what is, the \nmore \"motivated\" we are to change . \"Things must get bad enough, or \npeople will not change in any fundamental way.\"  \nThis leads to the mistaken be lief that fundamental change requires a \nthreat to survival.

An accurate, insightful view of current reality is as important as a clear \nvision. Unfortunately, most of us are in the habit of imposing biases \non our perceptions of current reality, a subject we will return to in \ndepth in the following chapter on mental models. \"We learn to rely on \nour concepts of reality more than on our observations,\" writes Robert \nFritz. \"It is more convenient to assume that reality is similar to our \npreconceived ideas than to freshly observe what we have before our \neyes.\"10 If the first choice in pursuing personal mastery is to be true to \nyour own vision, the second fundamental choice in support of \npersonal mastery is commitment to the truth.  \nBoth are equally vital to generating creative tension.

What do I care about the 'larger world' anyhow?\" All of  \nthese reactions are evidence of deep-seated beliefs.  \nRobert Fritz, who has worked with literally tens of thousands of \npeople to develop their creative capacities, has concluded that prac-\ntically all of us have a \"dominant belief that we are not able to fulfill our \ndesires.\" Where does this belief come from? Fritz argues that it is an \nalmost inevitable by-product of growing up:  \nAs children we learn what our limitations are. Children are rightfully \ntaught limitations essential to their survival. But too often this \nlearning is generalized. We are cons tantly told we can't have or can't \ndo certain things, and we may come  to assume that we have an \ninability to have what we want.\"  \nMost of us hold one of two contradictory beliefs that limit our \nability to create what we really want. The more common is belief in our \npowerlessness\u2014our inability to bring into being all the things we really \ncare about. The other belief center s on unworthiness\u2014that we do not \ndeserve to have what we truly desire. Fritz claims that he has met only \na handful of individuals who do not seem to have one or the other of \nthese underlying beliefs. Such an assertion is difficult to prove \nrigorously because it is difficult to measure deep beliefs. But if we \naccept it as a working premise, it il luminates systemic forces that can \nwork powerfully against creating what we really want.  \nFritz uses a metaphor to describe how contradictory underlying \nbeliefs work as a system, counter to achieving our goals. Imagine, as \nyou move toward your goal, there is a rubber band, symbolizing \ncreative tension, pulling you in the desired direction. But imagine also \na second rubber band, anchored to the belief of powerlessness or \nunworthiness. Just as the first rubber band tries to pull you toward your \ngoal, the second pulls you back toward the underlying belief that you \ncan't (or don't deserve to) have your goal. Fritz calls the system \ninvolving both the tension pulling us toward our goal and the tension \nanchoring us to our underlying belief \"structural conflict,\" because it is \na structure of conflicting forces: pu lling us simultaneously toward and \naway from what we want.  \nThus, the closer we come to achieving our vision, the more the \nsecond rubber band pulls us away from our vision. This force can \nmanifest itself in many ways. We might lose our energy. We might \nquestion whether we really wanted the vision. \"Finishing the job\" \nmight become increasingly difficult. Unexpected obstacles develop in \nour path. People let us down.

Yet, we do succeed sometimes, \nand in fact many of us have become adept at identifying and achieving \ngoals, at least in some areas of our lives. How do we overcome the \nforces of structural conflict?  \nFritz has identified three generic \"strategies\" for coping with the \nforces of structural conflict, each of which has its limitations.12 Letting \nour vision erode is one such coping strategy. The second is \"conflict \nmanipulation,\" in which we try to manipulate ourselves into greater \neffort toward what we want by crea ting artificial conflict, such as \nthrough focusing on avoiding what we don't want. Conflict \nmanipulation is the favored strategy of people who incessantly worry \nabout failure, managers who excel at \"motivational chats\" that point \nout the highly unpleasant consequences if the company's goals are not \nachieved, and of social movements that attempt to mobilize people \nthrough fear. In fact, sadly, most social movements operate through \nconflict manipulation or \"negative vision,\" focusing on getting away \nfrom what we don't want, rather than on creating what we do want: \nantidrugs, antinuclear arms, anti nuclear power, antismok-ing, anti-\nabortion, or antigovernment corruption.  \nBut many ask, \"What's wrong with a little worry or fear if it helps us \nachieve our goals?\" The response of those who seek personal mastery \nis the simple question: \"Do you really want to live your life in a state of \nfear of failure?\" The tragedy is that many people who get hooked on \nconflict manipulation come to believe that only through being in a \nstate of continual anxiety and fear can they be successful. These are \nthe people who, rather than shunning emotional tension, actually \ncome to glorify it. For them, there is little joy in life. Even when they \nachieve their goals, they immediately begin worrying about losing what \nthey have gained.  \nFritz's third generic strategy is the strategy of \"willpower,\" where", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2268, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "66ae189e-18c1-4266-aeb7-df797f203d2c": {"__data__": {"id_": "66ae189e-18c1-4266-aeb7-df797f203d2c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "143", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

Lyin g behind willpower strategies, he \nsuggests, is the simple assumption that we \"motivate ourselves \nthrough heightened volition.\" Willpower is so common among \nhighly successful people that many s ee its characteristics as synon-\nymous with success: a maniacal focus on goals, willingness to \"pay the \nprice,\" ability to defeat any opposition and surmount any obstacle.  \nThe problems with \"willpower\" are many, but they may hardly be \nnoticed by the person focused narrowly on \"success.\" First, there is \nlittle economy of means; in systems thinking terms, we act without \nleverage. We attain our goals, but the effort is enormous and we may \nfind ourselves exhausted and wondering if \"it was worth it\" when we \nhave succeeded. Ironically, people hooked on willpower may actually \nlook for obstacles to overcome, dragons to slay, and enemies to \nvanquish\u2014to remind themselves and others of their own prowess. \nSecond, there are often considerable unintended consequences. \nDespite great success at work, the master of \"willpower\" will often \nfind that he or she has gone through two marriages and has terrible \nrelationships with his or her children. Somehow, the same dogged \ndetermination and goal orientation that \"works\" at work doesn't quite \nturn the trick at home. (Chapter 16, \"Ending the War Between Work \nand Family,\" develops these ideas further.)  \nWorse still, just as with all of the coping strategies, \"willpower\" \nleaves the underlying system of structural conflict unaltered. In par-\nticular, the underlying belief in powerlessness has not really \nchanged. Despite significant accomplishments, many \"highly successful \npeople\" still feel a deep, usually unspoken, sense of powerlessness in \ncritical areas of their lives\u2014such as in their personal and family \nrelationships, or in their ability to achieve a sense of peace and \nspiritual fulfillment.  \nThese coping strategies are, to a certain extent, unavoidable. They \nare deeply habitual and cannot be changed overnight. We all tend to \nhave a favorite strategy\u2014mine has long been \"willpower,\" as those \nclose to me can attest.  \nWhere then is the leverage in dealing with structural conflict? If \nstructural conflict arises from deep underlying beliefs, then it can be \nchanged only by changing the beliefs.

But, in fact, being committed to the truth is far \nmore powerful than any technique.  \nCommitment to the truth does not  mean seeking the \"Truth,\" the \nabsolute final word or ultimate cause. Rather, it means a relentless \nwillingness to root out the ways we limit or deceive ourselves from \nseeing what is, and to continually challenge our theories of why \nthings are the way they are. It means continually broadening our \nawareness, just as the great athlete with extraordinary peripheral \nvision keeps trying to \"see more of the playing field.\" It also means \ncontinually deepening our understanding of the structures underlying \ncurrent events. Specifically, people with high levels of personal mastery \nsee more of the structural conflicts underlying their own behavior.  \nThus, the first critical task in dealing with structural conflicts is to \nrecognize them, and the resulting behavior, when they are operating. It \ncan be very difficult to recognize these coping strategies while we are \nplaying them out, especially becaus e of tensions and pressures that \noften accompany them.

Invariably, I ended up feeling as if \"I've got to do it all \nmyself.\"  \nOnce I recognized this pattern, I began to act differently when a \ncolleague let me down. I became angry less often. Rather, there was a \ntwinge of recognition\u2014\"Oh, there goes my pattern.\" I looked more \ndeeply at how my own actions were part of the outcome, either by \ncreating tasks that were impossible to accomplish, or by undermining \nor demotivating the other person. Further, I worked to develop skills \nto discuss such situations with the people involved without \nproducing defensiveness.

So long as I saw the \nproblem in terms of events, I was convinced that my problems were \nexternally caused\u2014 \"they let me down.\" Once I saw the problem as \nstructurally caused, I began to look at what I could do, rather than at \nwhat \"they had done.\"  \nStructures of which we are unaware hold us prisoner.

Sometimes these structures can be \nreadily changed. Sometimes, as with structural conflict, they change \nonly gradually. Then the need is to  w o r k  m or e c r e a t i v e l y  wi t h i n  t he m \nwhile acknowledging their origin, rath er than fighting the structures. \nEither way, once an operating structure is recognized, the structure \nitself becomes part of \"current re ality.\" The more my commitment to \nthe truth, the more creative tension comes into play because current \nreality is seen more for what it re ally is. In the context of creative \ntension, commitment to the truth becomes a generative force, just as \nvision becomes a generative force.  \nOne of the classic illustrations of this process is Charles Dickens's", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2699, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6c8591f-be9d-449d-8a21-b64cc9884912": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6c8591f-be9d-449d-8a21-b64cc9884912", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "146", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

Through the visitations of the three ghosts on \nChristmas Eve, Scrooge sees more and more of the reality from \nwhich he has turned away. He sees the reality of his past, how the \nchoices he made steadily whittled away his compassion and increased \nhis self-centeredness. He sees the reality of his present, especially \nthose aspects of reality that he has avoided, such as Tiny Tim's illness. \nAnd he sees the reality of his likely future, the future that will occur if \nhe continues in his present ways. But then he wakes up. He realizes that \nhe is not the captive of these realities. He realizes that he has a choice. \nHe chooses to change.  \nSignificantly, Scrooge can't make the choice to change before he \nbecomes more aware of his current reality. In effect, Dickens says \nthat life always avails the option of seeing the truth, no matter how \nblind and prejudiced we may be. And if we have the courage to \nrespond to that option, we have the power to change ourselves pro-\nfoundly. Or, to put it in more classic religious terms, only through the \ntruth do we come to grace.  \nThe power of the truth, seeing reality more and more as it is, \ncleansing the lens of perception, awakening from self-imposed dis-\ntortions of reality\u2014different expressions of a common principle in \nalmost all the world's great philosophic and religious systems.

The Koran \nends with the phrase, \"What a tragedy that man must die before he \nwakes up.\" The power of the truth was no less central to early \nChristian thinking, although it has lost its place in Christian practice \nover the last two thousand years. In fact, the Hebrew symbols used to \nform the word Yeheshua, \"Jesus,\" include the symbols for Jehovah, \" H \n1 H V with the additional letter shin (t\u00a3J) inserted in the middle. The \nsymbols for Jehovah carry the meaning, \"That which was, is, and will \nbe.\" The inserted shin modifies the meaning to \"that which was, is, and \nwill be, delivers.\" This is the probable origin of the statement \"The \ntruth shall set you free.\"  \nUSING THE SUBCONSCIOUS, OR, YOU DON'T REALLY \nNEED TO FIGURE IT ALL OUT  \nOne of the most fascinating aspects of people with high levels of \npersonal mastery is their ability to accomplish extraordinarily complex \ntasks with grace and ease.

Walking, talking, eating, putting on your shoes, and riding a \nbicycle are all accomplished with almost no conscious attention\u2014 yet \nall are, in fact, enormously complex tasks.  \nThese tasks are accomplished reliably because there is an aspect of \nour mind that is exceedingly capabl e of dealing with complexity. We \ncall this dimension of mind the \"subconscious,\" because it operates \n\"below\" or \"behind\" the level of conscious awareness. Others call it \n\"unconscious\" or \"automatic mind.\"14 Whatever it is called, without \nthis dimension of mind it would be quite impossible to explain how \nhuman beings ever succeed in mastering any complex task. For one \nthing we can say confidently is that these tasks are not accomplished \nthrough our normal awareness and thinking alone.  \nEqually important, the subconscious is critical to how we learn. At \none point in your life you were unable to carry out \"mundane\" tasks \nsuch as walking, talking and eating. Each had to be learned. The infant \ndoes not get the spoon in her mouth the first time out\u2014it goes over \nthe left shoulder, then the right shoulder, then the cheek. Only \ngradually does she learn to reliably reach her mouth. Initially, any new \ntask requires a great deal of conscious attention and effort. As we \n\"learn\" the skills required of the task, the whole activity gradually \nshifts from conscious attention to subconscious control.  \nFor example, when you first learned to drive a car, it took consid-\nerable conscious attention, especially if your were learning to drive on \na standard transmission. In fact, you might have found it difficult to \ncarry on a conversation with the person next to you. If that person had \nasked you to \"slow down, downshift, and turn right\" at the next corner, \nyou might have given up then and there. Yet, within a few months or \nless, you executed the same task with little or no conscious attention. \nIt had all become \"automatic.\" Amazingly, before long you drove in \nheavy traffic while carrying on a conversation with the person sitting \nnext to you\u2014apparently giving almost no conscious attention to the \nliterally hundreds of variables you had to monitor and respond to.  \nFor example, when we first learn to play the piano or any musical \ninstrument, we start by playing sc ales. Gradually, we move up to \nsimple and then more complex compositions, leaving scales behind as \na task that can be handled with little conscious attention. Even \nconcert pianists, when sitting down to an unfamiliar piece will play that \npiece at half speed in order to allow concentration on the mechanics \nof hand and pedal positions, rhythm and tempo.

This leaves his conscious \nattention to focus exclusively on the aesthetics of the performance.\"  \nWe have all mastered a vast repertoire of ski lls through \"training\" \nthe subconscious. Once learned, they become so taken for granted, \nso \"subconscious,\" we don't even notice when we are executing \nthem. But, for most of us, we have never given careful thought to \nhow we mastered these skills and how we might continue to develop \ndeeper and deeper \"rapport\" between our normal awareness and \nsubconscious. Yet, these are matters of the greatest importance to \nthe discipline of personal mastery.16 \nThis is why, for instance, people committed to continually devel-\noping personal mastery practice some form of \"meditation.\" \nWhether it is through contemplative prayer or other methods of simply \n\"quieting\" the conscious mind, regular meditative practice can be \nextremely helpful in working more productively with the subconscious \nmind. The subconscious appears to have no particular volition. It \nneither generates its own objectives nor determines its own focus. It \nis highly subject to direction and conditioning\u2014what we pay \nattention to takes on special significance to the subconscious. In our \nnormal highly active state of mind, the subconscious is deluged with a \nwelter of contradictory thoughts and feelings. In a quieter state of \nmind, when we then focus on something of particular importance, \nsome aspect of our vision, the subconscious is undistracted.  \nMoreover, there are particular ways that people with high levels of \npersonal mastery direct their focu s. As discussed earlier, they focus on \nthe desired result itself, not the \"process\" or the means they assume \nnecessary to achieve that result.  \nFocusing on the desired intrinsic result is a skill. For most of us it is \nnot easy at first, and takes time and patience to develop. For most of \nus, as soon as we think of some important personal goal, almost \nimmediately we think of all the reasons  why it will be hard to achieve \u2014\nthe challenges we will face and the obstacles we will have to overcome. \nWhile this is very helpful for thinking through alternative strategies for \nachieving our goals, it is also a sign of lack of discipline when thoughts \nabout \"the process\" of achieving our vision continually crowd out our \nfocus on the outcomes we seek. We must work at learning how to \nseparate what we truly want, from what we think we need to do in \norder to achieve it.  \nA useful starting exercise for lear ning how to focus more clearly on \ndesired results is to take any particular goal or aspect of your vision. \nFirst imagine that that goal is fully realized.

In fact, the goal is actually an \ninterim step they assume is necessary to reach a more important \nresult. For example, a person has a goal of reaching a certain level in \nthe organizational hierarchy. When she asks herself, \"What would it get \nme to be a senior VP?\" she discovers that the answer is \"respect of \nmy peers\" or \"being where the action is.\" Though she may still aspire \nto the position, she now sees that there is also a deeper result she \ndesires\u2014a result she can start to hold as part of her vision now, \nindependent of where she is in the organizational hierarchy. \n(Moreover, if she doesn't clarify \"the result\" she truly seeks, she may \nreach her stated goal and find that the more senior position is \nsomehow still dissatisfying.)  \nThe reason this skill is so important is precisely because of the \nresponsiveness of the subconscious to a clear focus. When we are \nunclear between interim goals and more intrinsic goals, the subcon-\nscious has no way of prioritizing and focusing.  \nMaking clear choices is also important. Only after choice are the \ncapabilities of the subconscious brought fully into play. In fact, making \nchoices and focusing on the results that are really important to us \nmay be one of the highest leverage uses of our normal awareness.

When his passion, his desire, becomes so \nstrong as to rise out of his body like steam, and when the \ncondensation of that which evaporated occurs . . . and drops back \nlike raindrops, he will find his problem solved.  \nCommitment to the truth is also important for developing subcon-\nscious rapport\u2014for the same basic reasons that lie detectors work. \nLie detectors work because when most human beings do not tell the \ntruth they create some level of internal stress, which in turn generates \nmeasurable physiological effects\u2014 blood pressure, pulse rate, and \nrespiration. So, not only does dece iving ourselves about current reality \nprevent the subconscious from having accurate information about \nwhere we are relative to our vision, but it also creates distracting input \nto the subconscious, just as our \"c hatter\" about why we can't achieve \nour vision is distracting. The principle of creative tension recognizes \nthat the subconscious operates most effectively when it is focused \nclearly on our vision and our current reality.  \nThe art of working effectively with the subconscious incorporates", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2714, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2fe2e4e-e36a-479f-8405-98ab98f5b497": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2fe2e4e-e36a-479f-8405-98ab98f5b497", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "151", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

An effective way to focus the Subconscious is \nthrough imagery and visualization. For example, world-class swim-\nmers have found that by imagining their hands to be twice their \nactual size and their feet to be webbed, they actually swim faster. \n\"Mental rehearsal\" of complex feats ha s become routine psychological \ntraining for diverse professional performers.  \nBut the real effectiveness of all of this still hinges on knowing what it \nis that is most important to you. In the absence of knowing what truly \nmatters to you, the: specific practices and methods of working with the \nsubconscious run the risk of becoming mechanical techniques\u2014simply \na new way of manipulating yourself into being more productive. This is \nnot an idle concern. Almost all spiritual traditions warn against \nadopting the techniques of increased mental powers without diligently \ncontinuing to refine one's sense of genuine aspiration.  \nUltimately, what matters most in  developing the subconscious \nrapport characteristic of masters is the genuine caring for a desired \noutcome, the deep feeling of it being the \"right\" goal toward which to \naspire. The subconscious seems especi ally receptive to goals in line \nwith our deeper aspirations and va lues. According to some spiritual \ndisciplines, this is because these de eper aspirations input directly to, \nor are part of, the subconscious mind.  \nA wonderful example of what can be accomplished in the pursuit of \nsomething truly important to a person is the story of Gilbert Kaplan, a \nhighly successful publisher and editor of a leading investment \nperiodical. Kaplan first heard Ma hler's Second Symphony in a re-\nhearsal in 1965. He \"found himself unable to sleep. I went back for \nthe performance and walked out of the hall a different person. It was \nthe beginning of a long love affair.\" Despite his having had no formal \nmusical training, he committed time and energy and a considerable sum \nof his personal finances (he had to hire an orchestra) to the pursuit \nof learning how to conduct the piece. Today, his performances of the \nsymphony have received the highest praise by critics throughout the \nworld. The New York Times praised his 1988 recording of the \nsymphony with the London Symphony Orchestra as one of the five \nfinest classical recordings of th e year and the president of the New \nYork Mahler Society called it \"the outstanding recorded \nperformance.\" A strict reliance on only conscious learning could \nnever have achieved this level of artistry, even with all the \"willpower\" \nin the world.

This is why the con cept of vision has always figured so \nstrongly in the creative arts. Picasso once said: \nIt would be very interesting to record photographically, not the \nstages of a painting, but its metamorphoses. One would see perhaps \nby what course a mind finds its way toward the crystallization of its \ndream.

Many of these are quite \nsubtle and often go unnoticed. In addition to clarifying the \"struc-\ntures\" that characterize personal mastery as a discipline (such as \ncreative tension, emotional tension,  and structural conflict), the sys-\ntems perspective also illuminates subtler aspects of personal mastery \u2014\nespecially: integrating reason and intuition; continually seeing more of \nour connectedness to the world; compassion; and commitment to the \nwhole. \nINTEGRATING REASON AND INTUITION \nAccording to an ancient Sufi story, a blind man wandering lost in a \nforest tripped and fell. As the blind man rummaged about the forest \nfloor he discovered that he had fa llen over a cripple. The blind man \nand the cripple struck up a conversation, commiserating on their \nfate. The blind man said, \"I have been wandering in this forest for as \nlong as I can remember, and I cannot see to find my way out.\" The \ncripple said, \"I have been lying on the forest floor for as long as I can \nremember, and I cannot get up to walk out.\" As they sat there talking, \nsuddenly the cripple cried out. \"I've got it,\" he said. \"You hoist me up \nonto your shoulders and I will tell yo u where to walk.

Rath er, they achieve it naturally\u2014as a \nby-product of their commitment to use all resources at their dis-; \nposal. They cannot afford to choose between reason and intuition* or \nhead and heart, any more than they would choose to walk on one1 leg \nor see with one eye.  \nBilateralism is a design principle underlying the evolution of ad-\nvanced organisms. Nature seems to ha ve learned to design in pairs;; it \nnot only builds in redundancy but achieves capabilities not possible \notherwise. Two legs are critical fo r rapid, flexible locomotion. Two \narms and hands are vital for climbing, lifting, and manipulating objects. \nTwo eyes give us stereoscopic vision, and along with two; ears, \ndepth perception. Is it not possible that, following the same design \nprinciple, reason and intuition are designed to work in harmony for \nus to achieve our potential intelligence?  \nSystems thinking may hold a key to integrating reason and intuition. \nIntuition eludes the grasp of linear thinking, with its exclusive \nemphasis on cause and effect that are close in time and space. The \nresult is that most of our intuitions don't make \"sense\"\u2014that is, \nthey can't be explained in terms of linear logic.  \nVery often, experienced managers have rich intuitions about com-\nplex systems, which they cannot explain. Their intuitions tell them that \ncause and effect are not close in  time and space, that obvious \nsolutions will produce more harm than good, and that short-term \nfixes produce long-term problems. But they cannot explain their \nideas in simple linear cause-effect language. They end up saying, \"Just \ndo it this way. It will work.\"  \nFor example, many managers sense the dangers of eroding goals or \nstandards but cannot fully explain how they create a reinforcing", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2677, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "163845e0-0ac0-4204-9f09-f5b3154c47f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "163845e0-0ac0-4204-9f09-f5b3154c47f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

This increased his \ndiscomfort, which led him to get more agitated and pull still harder. \nThe poor little guy might still be pulling if I hadn't detached his hand \nand quieted him down.  \nNot knowing that his hand was actually within his control, he \nperceived the source of his discomfort as an external force.

However well intent \ntioned, such programs are probably th e most sure-fire way to impede \nthe genuine spread of commitment to personal mastery in an organi- \nzation. Compulsory training, or \"elective\" programs that people feell \nexpected to attend if they want to advance their careers, conflict' \ndirectly with freedom of choice. \nFor example, there have been numerous instances in recent years of \noverzealous managers requiring empl oyees to participate in personal \ndevelopment training, which the employees regarded as contradictory \nto their own religious beliefs. Several of these have resulted in legal \naction against the organization.20 \nWhat then can leaders intent on fostering personal mastery do? \nThey can work relentlessly to foster a climate in which the princi- ples \nof personal mastery are practiced in daily life. That means building an \norganization where it is safe for people to create visions, where \ninquiry and commitment to the truth are the norm, and where \\ \nchallenging the status quo is expected\u2014especially when the status \nquo includes obscuring aspects of current reality that people seek to \navoid. \nSuch an organizational climate will strengthen personal mastery in \ntwo ways.

What we carry in our heads are images, assumptions, \nand stories. Philosophers have disc ussed mental models for centuries, \ngoing back at least to Plato's parable of the cave. \"The Emperor's \nNew Clothes\" is a classic story, not about fatuous people, but about \npeople bound by mental models. Their image of the monarch's dignity \nkept them from seeing his naked figure as it was.  \nIn surveying the accomplishments of cognitive science in his book \nThe Mind's New Science, Howard Gardner writes, \"To my mind, the \nmajor accomplishment of cognitive science has been the clear \ndemonstration of. . .  a level of mental representation\" active in \ndiverse aspects of human behavior.1 Our \"mental models\" determine \nnot only how we make sense of the world, but how we take action. \nHarvard's Chris Argyris, who has worked with mental models and \norganizational learning for thirty years, puts it this way: \"Although \npeople do not [always] behave congruently with their espoused \ntheories [what they say], they do behave congruently with their \ntheories-in-use [their mental models].\"2 \nMental models can be simple gene ralizations such as \"people are \nuntrustworthy,\" or they can be complex theories, such as my as-\nsumptions about why members of my family interact as they do. But \nwhat is most important to grasp is that mental models are active \u2014 they \nshape how we act. If we believe people are untrustworthy, we act \ndifferently from the way we would if we believed they were \ntrustworthy. If I believe that my son lacks self-confidence and my \ndaughter is highly aggressive, I wi ll continually intervene in their \nexchanges to prevent her from damaging his ego.  \nWhy are mental models so powerful in affecting what we do? In part, \nbecause they affect what we see. Two people with different mental \nmodels can observe the same event and describe it differently, \nbecause they've looked at different details. When you and I walk into \na crowded party, we both take in the same basic sensory data, but we \npick out different faces. As psychologists say, we observe selectively. \nThis is no less true for supposed ly \"objective\" observers such as \nscientists than for people in general. As Albert Einstein once wrote, \n\"Our theories determine what we measure.\" For years, physicists ran \nexperiments that contradicted classical physics, yet no one \"saw\" the \ndata that these experiments eventually provided, leading to the \nrevolutionary theories\u2014quantum mechanics and relativity\u2014of \ntwentieth-century physics.3 \nThe way mental models shape our perceptions (is no less important in \nmanagement.

In fact, the team's computer \nsimulations predicted that deliveries  would lag further during business \ndownturns than during booms\u2014a prediction which ran counter to \nconventional wisdom, but which turned out to be true.  \nImpressed, the firm's top executives put into effect a new policy \nbased on the analysts' recommendat ions. From now on, when orders \nfell, they would maintain production  rates and try to improve delivery \nperformance. During the 1970 recession, the experiment worked; \nthanks to prompter deliveries and more repeat buying from satisfied \ncustomers, the firm's market share increased. The managers were so \npleased that they set up their own systems group. But the new policies \nwere never taken to heart, and the improvement proved temporary. \nDuring the ensuing business recovery, the managers stopped worrying \nabout delivery service. Four years later, when the more severe OPEC-\ninduced recession came, they went back to their original policy of \ndramatic production cutbacks.  \nWhy discard such a successful experiment? The reason was the \nmental models deeply embedded in the firm's management traditions. \nEvery production manager knew in his heart that there was no more \nsure-fire way to destroy his career than to be held responsible for \nstockpiling unsold good s in the ware house. Generations of top \nmanagement had preached the gospel of commitment to inventory \ncontrol.

As it happens, several organizations, largely ops erating \nindependently, have given serious atte ntion to this question! in recent \nyears. \nINCUBATING   A NEW   \nBUSINESS   WORLDVIEW \nPerhaps the first large corporation to discover the potential power of \nmental models in learning was Royal Dutch/Shell. Managing a highly \ndecentralized company through the turbulence of the world oil business \nin the 1970s, Shell discovered that, by helping managers clarify their \nassumptions, discover internal cont radictions in those assumptions, \nand think through new strategies based on new assumptions they \ngained a unique source of competitive advantage. \nShell is unique in several ways th at have made it a natural environ-\nment for experimenting with mental models. It is truly multicultural, \nformed originally in 1907 from a \"gentleman's agreement\" between \nRoyal Dutch Petroleum and the London-based Shell Transport and \nTrading Company. Royal Dutch/Shell now has more than a hundred! \noperating companies around the world, led by managers from almost as \nmany different cultures. \nThe operating companies enjoy a high degree of autonomy and \nlocal independence. From its beginning, Shell managers had to learn to \noperate by consensus, because there was no way these \"gentlemen\" \nfrom different countries and cultures would be able to tell each other \nwhat to do. As Shell grew and became more global and more \nmulticultural, its needs for building consensus across vast gulfs of \nstyle and understanding grew. \nIn the turbulent early 1970s, Shell's tradition of consensus man-\nagement was stretched to the brea king point. What emerged was a \nnew understanding of the underpinnings of real consensus\u2014an un-\nderstanding of shared mental models. \"Unless we influenced the \nmental image, the picture of reality held by critical decisionmakers, our \nscenarios would be like water on a stone,\" recalled Shell's former \nsenior planner Pierre Wack, in his seminal Harvard Business", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2307, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4c4a805-fcd6-447f-9c8c-5a9d83a30644": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4c4a805-fcd6-447f-9c8c-5a9d83a30644", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "164", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

Europe, Japan, and the U.S. \nwere becoming increasingly dependent on oil imports. Oil-exporting \nnations such as Iran, Iraq, Libya, and Venezuela were becoming \nincreasingly concerned with falling reserves. Others, such as Saudi \nArabia, were reaching the limits of th eir ability to productively invest oil \nrevenues. These trends meant that the historical, smooth growth in \noil demand and supply would eventually give way to chronic supply \nshortfalls, excess demand, and a \"seller's market\" controlled by the \noil-exporting nations. While Shell's planners did not predict OPEC \nexactly, they foresaw the types of changes that OPEC would eventualy \nbring about. Yet, attempts to impress upon Shell's managers the \nradical shifts ahead had led \"no more than a third of Shell's critical \ndecision centers\" to act on the new insights.  \nIn principle, Shell's \"Group Planning\" staff were in an ideal posi-\ntion to disseminate insights about the changes ahead. Group \nPlanning was the central planning department, responsible for coor-\ndinating planning activities in ope rating companies worldwide. At the \ntime, Group Planning was developing a new technique called \n\"scenario planning,\" a method fo r summarizing alternative future \ntrends. The planners at Shell began to build in the coming discontin-\nuities into their scenarios. But their audience of Shell managers \nfound these new scenarios so contradictory to their years of experi-\nence with predictable growth that th ey paid little attention to them.  \nAt this point, Wack and his colleagues realized that they had fun-\ndamentally misperceived their task. From that moment, Wack \nwrote, \"We no longer saw our task as producing a documented view of \nthe future . . . Our real target was the 'microcosms' \"\u2014Wack's word \nfor mental models\u2014\"of our decision makers . . . We now wanted to \ndesign scenarios so that managers would question their own model of \nreality and change it when necessary .\" If the planners had once thought \ntheir job was delivering information to the decision makers, it was now \nclear that their task was to help managers rethink their worldview.

Then they helped managers begin the process of construct-\ning a new mental model\u2014by helping them think through how the, \nwould have to manage in this new world. For example, exploration for \noil would have to expand to new countries, while refinery build ing \nwould have to slow down because of  higher prices and conse- quently \nslower demand growth. Also, with greater instability nations would \nrespond differently. Some, with free -market tradi- tions, would let the \nprice rise freely; others with controlled-market policies, would try to \nkeep it low. Thus, control to She ll's locally based operating companies \nwould have to increase to enable them to adapt to local conditions.  \nAlthough many Shell managers remained skeptical, they took the \nnew scenarios seriously because they began to see that their present \nunderstandings were untenable. The exercise had begun to unfreeze \nmanagers' mental models and incubate a new world view.  \nWhen the OPEC oil embargo sudd enly became a reality in the1 \nwinter of 1973-74, Shell responded differently from the other oi| \ncompanies. They slowed down their investments in refineries, and] \ndesigned refineries that could adapt to whatever type of crude oil was \navailable.

In \n1970, Shell had been considered the weakest of the seven largest toil \ncompanies.

As noted earlier, it has \ngone from near-bankruptcy in 1969,  when it was acquired by the \nState Mutual company, to one of the best performing companies in \nthe property and casualty industry today. At $1.5 billion in annual \npremium sales, Hanover handles only one tenth of the volume of an \nindustry giant such as Aetna, but its compound rate of return since \n1980 has been 19 percent, which ranks sixteenth among sixty-eight \ninsurance companies surveyed by Forbes in January 1990. \nBeginning in 1969, Hanover took on a long-term mission to revamp \nthe traditional hierarchical values that had dominated the organization \nfor so long. \"We set out,\" says O\\Brien, \"to find what would give the \nnecessary organization and discipline to have work be more congruent \nwith human nature.

Open-\nness was seen as an antidote to what O'Brien called \"the disease of \ngamesplaying that dominated people's behavior in face-to-face meetings. \nNobody described an issue at 10:00 in the morning at a business meeting \nthe way they described the issue at 7:00 that evening, at home or \nover drinks with friends.\" Merit \u2014making decisions based on the best \ninterests of the organization \u2014was Hanover's antidote to \n\"decisionmaking based on bureaucratic politics, where the name of the \ngame is getting ahead by making an impression, or, if you're already at \nthe top, staying there.\"9 As openness and merit took hold, a deep belief \nevolved from them: that decision-making processes could be \ntransformed if people become more able to surface and discuss \nproductively their different ways of looking at the world. But if this was \nso useful why did it seem so difficult?  \nIn the mid-1970s, the ideas of Argyris and his colleagues were \nbeginning to provide an answer. In \"action science,\" they were \ndeveloping a body of theory and method for reflection and inquiry on \nthe reasoning that underlies our actions.10 Moreover, the tools of action \nscience are designed to be effective in organizations, and especially in \ndealing with organizational problems. We trap ourselves, say Argyris \nand his colleagues, in \"defensive routines\" that insulate our mental \nmodels from examination, and we consequently develop \"skilled \nincompetence\"\u2014a marvelous oxymoron that Argyris uses to describe \nmost adult learners, who are \"highly skillful at protecting themselves \nfrom pain and threat posed by learning situations,\" but consequently \nfail to learn how to produce the results they really want.  \nDespite having read much of his writing, I was unprepared for \nwhat I learned when I first saw Chris Argyris practice his approach in \nan informal workshop with a half-dozen members of our research team \nat MIT. Ostensibly an academic presentation of Argyris's methods, it \nquickly evolved into a powerful demonstration of what action science \npractitioners call \"reflection in action.\" Argyris asked each of us to \nrecount a conflict with a client, colleague, or family member. We had \nto recall not only what was said, but what we were thinking and did \nnot say. As Chris began to \"work with these cases it became almost \nimmediately apparent how each of us contributed to a conflict through \nour own thinking\u2014how we made sweeping generalizations about the \nothers that determined what we said and how we behaved.

As  the afternoon moved on, all of us \nwere led to see (sometimes for the first time in our lives) subtle \npatterns of reasoning which underlay our behavior; and how those \npatterns continually got us into trouble. I had never had such a \ndramatic demonstration of my own ment al models in action, dictating \nmy behavior and perceptions. But even more interesting, it became \nclear that, with proper training, I could become much more aware of \nmy mental models and how they operated. This was exciting.  \nLater I learned that O'Brien and his management team at Hanover \nhad had a similar experience with Argyris's methods ten years earlier. \nThis had led them to realize that, in O'Brien's words, \"Despite our \nphilosophy we had a very long way to go to being able to have the \ntypes of open, productive discussion about critical issues that we all \ndesired. In some cases, Argyris' work revealed painfully obvious \ngamesplaying that we had come to accept.

Yet, he was also not si mply advocating \"tell everyone \neverything\"\u2014he was illustrating the skills of engaging difficult issues \nso that everyone learned. Clearly, this was important new territory if \nwe were really going to live our core values of openness and merit.\"  \nWorking with Argyris's colleague Lee Bolman, also of Harvard, \nHanover eventually developed a three-day management seminar, \ncalled \"Merit, Opennness, and Localness,\" intended to expose all \nHanover managers to the basic ideas and practices of action science. \nThese seminars have been attended by virtually all of Hanover's \nmiddle and upper management over the past ten years. The basic \npurpose of the seminars is to extend the practice of these three core \nvalues by showing the skills needed^ttKput them into practice.

Most find this enlightening but hardly earth-\nshaking. \"Yes, of course, I agree with this. I always try very hard to be \na good inquirer\" is a typical response at the end of Day 1. The lights \nstart to go on in Day 2, when Stimson and his colleagues video tape the \nmanagers attempting to apply the skills  in role-playing exercises. Before \ntheir role-playing, the managers identify particular skills they want to \nwork on. For example, a manager in a performance review role-play \nmight want to work on \"balancing inquiry and advocacy\" (taking a \nposition but also inquiring into others' views and remaining open). \nBut within a few minutes of starting the role-play, the very same \nmanager will be pointing his finger at the subordinate and preaching \nrather than listening. \"When everyone watches the tapes together \nafterward,\" Stimson says, \"it is often hilarious to see how much our \nown behavior deviates from what we say we do. People see that there \nis much more to putting action science skills into practice than merely \nnodding in agreement.\"  \nThe three-days of the MOL semina r are hardly enough to become \nmasters in the skills of action science, but the very personal exposure \nand initial opportunity to practice with a group of fellow learners \nstarts a process that continues \"back home.\" Perhaps, equally \nimportant, it shows Hanover's seriousness about approaching the \nmental models discipline as a set of developable skills, not as vague \ngeneralities and pieties about \"thinking more effectively.\"  \nConvinced that there was a payoff  in helping managers improve \ntheir basic thinking skills, Hanover later supported a second manage-\nment training to, as O'Brien puts it, \"expose the limitations of \n'mechanistic thinking.' The problem we saw was the tendency of \nmanagers to confront complex business issues with '9-point pro-\ngrams,' as if the problem was fixing a flat tire. This usually results in \nmaking problems worse.\" This second training program, \"Thinking \nabout Thinking,\" was designed and delivered by a retired University of \nNew Hampshire professor, John Beckett.

Through training, frequent management bulletins, and contin-\nual practice, the firm attempts to build a foundation of basic skills in \nreflection, surfacing, and public examination of mental models. The \naudience target for these efforts is managers throughout the com-\npany, not just a small group of \"mental model experts.\" As for the \nskills themselves, we will look closely at them shortly within the next \nsection. They include: \n\u2022 Recognizing \"leaps of abstraction\" (noticing our jumps from ob \nservation to generalization) \n\u2022 Exposing the \"left-hand column\" (articulating what we normally \ndo not say) \n\u2022 Balancing inquiry and advocacy (skills for honest investigation) \n\u2022 Facing up to distinctions betw een espoused theories (what we \nsay) and theories-in-use (the im plied theory in what we do) \nIt is interesting how personal these skills are. The skills cover not just \nbusiness issues, but everyday relationships. The discipline concentrates \non something which people normally take for granted: how we conduct \nourselves in ordinary conversation, especially when complex and \nconflictual issues are on the table. Most of us believe that all we have \nto do is \"act naturally\"; yet the discipline of mental models retrains our \nnatural inclinations so that conversations can produce genuine \nlearning, rather than merely reinforcing prior views. \nTHE   DISCIPLINE OF   \nMENTAL   MODELS \nDeveloping an organization's capacity to work with mental models \ninvolves both learning new skills and implementing institutional in-\nnovations that help bring these skil ls into regular practice. Though \nShell and Hanover took immensely di fferent approaches to managing \nmental models, their work required th e same critical tasks. First, they \nhad to bring key assumptions about important business issues to the \nsurface. This goal, predominant at Shell, is vital to any company, \nbecause the most crucial mental models in any organization are those \nshared by key decision makers.

Second, the two companies had to develop the face-to-\nface learning skills. This was of special concern at Hanover because \nthey wanted managers throughout the company to be skillful with \nmental models.  \nBoth sides of the discipline\u2014busin ess skills and interpersonal is-\nsues\u2014are crucial. On the one hand, managers are inherently pragmatic \n(thank goodness). They are most motivated to learn what they need to \nlearn in their business context. Tr aining them in mental modeling or \n\"balancing inquiry and advocacy,\" with no connection to pressing \nbusiness issues, will often be rejected. Or, it will lead to people having \n\"academic\" skills they do not use. On the other hand, without the \ninterpersonal skills, learning is still fundamentally adaptive, not \ngenerative. Generative learning, in my experience, requires managers \nwith reflection and inquiry skills, not just consultants and planners. \nOnly then will people at all levels surface and challenge their mental \nmodels before external circumstances compel rethinking.  \nAs more companies adopt them, these two aspects of mental mod-\neling will become increasingly integrated. In the meantime, based on the \nexperience of Shell, Hanover, and other companies, we can begin to \npiece together the elements of an emerging discipline.  \n\"PLANNING AS LEARNING\" AND \"INTERNAL BOARDS\":  \nMANAGING MENTAL MODELS THROUGHOUT  \nAN ORGANIZATION  \nInstitutionalizing reflection and surfacing mental models require \nmechanisms that make these practices unavoidable. Two approaches \nthat have emerged to date involve recasting traditional planning as \nlearning and establishing \"internal boards of directors\" to bring senior \nmanagement and local management together regularly to challenge and \nexpand the thinking behind local decision making.  \nOnce Shell's planners had recognized the importance of articulating \nmental models, they had to develop ways to foster that articulation in \nover one hundred independent operating companies. That need for \nglobal reach is one factor behind Shell's unique approach to mental \nmodels, which involves developing and testing a variety of different \ntools in Group Planning >n~t\u00bbondon, then disseminating them. \nEventually, local planner&master these tools for use with local company \noperating managers.  \nScenarios, the first tool Shell adapted in pursuit of mental models,", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2407, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b2ef45d-5232-486d-89ee-50d3004e33e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b2ef45d-5232-486d-89ee-50d3004e33e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "173", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

This offsets the tendency for man-\nagers to implicitly assume a single future. When groups of managers \nshare a range of alternative futures in their mental models, they \nbecome more perceptive of changes in the business environment and \nmore responsive to those changes.  These are exactly the advantages \nthat Shell enjoyed over its comp etitors during the post-OPEC era.  \nBeyond scenarios, Shell continues to  experiment with a wide variety \nof tools for \"mapping\" mental models. These include the systems \nthinking tools presented in Chapters 4 through 8, as well as the \ncomputer simulation ca pabilities described in Chapter 17, \"Micro-\nworlds,\" and numerous other \"soft systems\" tools\u2014so called be-\ncause they deal with important nonquantifiable variables which are \nusually prominent in managers' mental models.\"  \nThe common denominator of all these tools is that they work to \nexpose assumptions about important business issues. Shell has insti-\ntutionalized managing mental models through its planning process. \nShell managers still generate traditional budget and control plans. But \nDe Geus and his colleagues have come to rethink the role of planning \nin large institutions. It is less important, they have concluded, to \nproduce perfect plans than to use plan ning to accelerate learning as a \nwhole. Long-term success, according to De Geus, depends on, \"the \nprocess whereby management teams change their shared mental \nmodels of their company, their ma rkets, and their competitors. For \nthis reason we think of planning as learning and of corporate planning \nas institutional learning.\" De Geus goes on to say that the critical \nquestion in planning is, \"Can we accelerate institutional learning.?' \"12 \nHanover has its own way of institutionalizing mental models. \nThere the process is guided by a set of operating principles, embedded \nin a novel organization structure.

If we went out to the field \nand said, 'this is the authorized mental model for handling situation \n23C,' we'd have a problem.\" Several points in the credo reinforce \nthis theme. The second point, for example, cautions against imposing \na favored mental model on people. \"In other words,\" says O'Brien, \n\"there may be a temptation for the loudest guy, or the highest-\nranking guy, to assume that everyone else will swallow his mental \nmodels lock, stock, and barrel in sixty seconds. Even if his mental \nmodel is better, his role is not to inoculate everyone else with it, but to \nhold it up for them to consider.\"  \nOther points of the credo say that people are more effective when \nthey develop their own models\u2014even if mental models from more \nexperienced people can avoid mistakes. \"Sometimes I might say, 'If \nBilly's going to learn how to ride a bike, he's going to have to fall \ndown.' I don't want him to scrape his knee or his elbow; but if it's \nnecessary, I might let that happen. Because, to get through life, he's \ngot to learn how to ride a bike.\"  \nIt's important to note that th e goal is not agreement or con-\ngruency. Many mental models can exist at once.

This will often lead \nto inquiring into the reasons behind one another's actions. Such inquiry \nrequires skills that will be discussed below. For example, just coming \nup to Laura and asking, \"Don't you care very much about people?\" \nis likely to evoke a defensive reaction. There are ways of approaching \nsuch exchanges, through owning up to our assumptions about others \nand citing the data upon which they are based, that reduce the \nchances of defensiveness.  \nBut until we become aware of our leaps of abstraction, we are not \neven aware of the need for inquiry. This is precisely why practicing \nreflection as a discipline is so important. A second technique from \naction science, the \"left-hand column ,\" is especially useful both in \nstarting and deepening this discipline.  \nLeft-Hand Column. This is a powerful technique for beginning to \n\"see\" how our mental models operate in particular situations. It \nreveals ways that we manipulate situations to avoid dealing with how we \nactually think and feel, and thereby prevent a counterproductive \nsituation from improving.  \nThe left-hand column exercise can show managers that, indeed, \nthey have mental models and those models play an active, sometimes \nunwelcome part in management prac tice. Once a group of managers \nhave gone through the exercises, not only are they aware of the role of \ntheir mental models but they begin to see why dealing with their \nassumptions more forthrightly is important.  \nThe \"left-hand column\" comes from a type of case presentation \nused by Chris Argyris and his colleagues. It starts with selecting a \nspecific situation where I am interacting with one or several other \npeople in a way that I feel is no t working\u2014specifically, that is not \nproducing any apparent learning or moving ahead. I write out a \nsample of the exchange, in the form of a script. I write the script on \nthe right-hand side of a page. On the left-hand side, I write what I \nam thinking but not saying at  each stage in the exchange.  \nFor example, imagine an exchange with a colleague, Bill, after a \nbig presentation to our boss on a project we are doing together. I had \nto miss the presentation, but I've heard that it was poorly received.  \n{ \nME: HOW did the presentation go?  \nBILL: Well, I don't know. It's really  too early to say.

Neither may be literally true, but \nboth are evident in my internal di alogue and both influence the way I \nhandle the situation. My belief in his lack of confidence shows up in my \nskirting the fact that I have heard that the presentation was a bomb. \nI'm afraid that if I say it directly, he will lose what little confidence he \nhas, or he will not be able to face the evidence. So, I bring up the \nsubject of the presentation obliquely . My belief in Bill's lack of \ninitiative comes up when we discuss what to do next. He gives no \nspecific course of action despite my question. I see this as evidence of \nhis laziness or lack of initiative: he is content to do nothing when \nsomething definitely is required, from which I conclude that I will \nhave to manufacture some form of pressure to motivate him into \naction, or else I will simply have to take matters into my own hands.  \nThe most important lesson that comes from seeing \"our left-hand \ncolumns\" is how we undermine opportunities for learning in conflic-\ntual situations.

Perhaps I avoid the \nissues out of a sense of politeness or desire not to be critical. \nWhatever the reason, the outcome is a dissatisfying exchange and I \nresort to looking for a way to \"manip ulate\" Bill into a more forceful \nresponse.  \nThere is no one \"right\" way to handle difficult situations such as my \nexchange with Bill, but it helps enormously to see first how my own \nreasoning and actions can contribute to making matters worse.

Most managers are trained to be \na dvocates . In fa ct, in ma ny compa nies , wha t it  means  t o be a  com-\npetent manager is to be able to solve problems\u2014to figure out what \nneeds to be done, and enlist what ever support is needed to get it \ndone. Individuals became successful in  part because of their abilities to \ndebate forcefully and influence others. Inquiry skills, meanwhile, go \nunrecognized and unrewarded. But as managers rise to senior \npositions, they confront issues mo re complex and diverse than their \npersonal experience. Suddenly, they need to tap insights from other \npeople. They need to learn. Now the manager's advocacy skills be-\ncome counterproductive; they can close us off from actually learning \nfrom one another. What is needed is blending advocacy and inquiry to \npromote collaborative learning.  \nEven when two advocates meet fo r an open, candid exchange of \nviews, there is usually little learning. They may be genuinely interested \nin each other's views, but pure advocacy lends a different type of \nstructure to the conversation:  \n\"I appreciate your sincerity, but my experience and judgment lead \nme to some different conclusions. Let me tell you why your pro-\nposal won't work ...\"  \nAs each side reasonably and calmly advocates his viewpoint just a bit \nmore strongly, positions become more and more rigid. Advocacy \nwithout inquiry begets more advoca cy. In fact, there is a systems \narchetype that describe s what happens next; ca lled \"escalation,\" it's \nthe same structure as an arms race.  \nThe more vehemently A argues, the greater the threat to B.

One indicator of a team in \ntrouble is when in a several hour meeting there are few, if any, \nquestions. This may seem amazing but I have seen meetings that \nwent for three hours without a single question being asked! You \ndon't have to be an \"action science\" expert to know there is not a \nlot of inquiry going on in such meetings.  \nBut pure inquiry is also limited. Questioning can be crucial for \nbreaking the spiral of reinforcing advocacy, but until a team or an \nindividual learns to combine inquiry and advocacy, learning skills are \nvery limited. One reason that pure inquiry is limited is that we almost \nalways do have a view, regardless of whether or not we believe that \nour view is the only correct one. Thus, just asking lots of questions \ncan be a way of avoiding learning\u2014by hiding our own view behind a \nwall of incessant questioning.  \nThe most productive learning usually occurs when managers com-\nbine skills in advocacy and inquiry. Another way to say this is \"re-\nciprocal inquiry.\" By this we mean that everyone makes his or her \nthinking explicit and subject to public examination. This creates an \natmosphere of genuine vulnerability. No one is hiding the evidence or \nreasoning behind his views\u2014advancing them without making them \nopen to scrutiny. For example, when inquiry and advocacy are \nbalanced, I would not only be inquiring into the reasoning behind \nothers' views but would be stating my views in such a way as to \nreveal my own assumptions and reasoning and toJnvite others to \ninquire into them. I might say, \"Here is my viey and here is how I \nhave arrived at it. How do es it sound to you?\"^'  \nWhen operating in pure advocacy, the goal is to win the argument. \nWhen inquiry and advocacy are combined, the goal is no longer \"to \nwin the argument\" but to find the best argument.

By contrast, when both advocacy and \ninquiry are high, we are open to disconfirming data as well as \nconfirming data\u2014because we are genuinely interested in finding, \nflaws in our views. Likewise, we expose our reasoning and look for \nflaws in it, and we try to understand others' reasoning. \nThe ideal of combining inquiry and advocacy is challenging. It can, be \nespecially difficult if you work in a highly political organization that is \nnot open to genuine inquiry (Chapter 13, Openness, deals with this \nsubject further). Speaking as a vete ran advocate, I can say that I have \nfound patience and perseverence needed to move toward a more \nbalanced approach. Progress comes in  stages. For me, the first stage \nwas learning how to inquire into others' views when I do not agree \nwith them. My habitual response  to such disagreements was to \nadvocate my view harder. Usually, this was done without malice but in \nthe genuine belief that I had thought things through and had a valid \nposition. Unfortunately, it often had the consequence of polarizing or \nterminating discussions, and left me without the sense of partnership I \ntruly wanted. Now, I very often respond to differences of view by \nasking the other person to say more about how he came to his view, or \nto expand further on his view. (I am  only starting to get to a second \nstage of stating my views so as to invite others to inquire into them as \nwell.) \nThough I am still a novice in the discipline of balancing inquiry and \nadvocacy, the rewards have been gratifying. What has become obvious \non repeated occasions is that, when there is inquiry and advocacy, \ncreative outcomes are much more likely. In a sense, when two people \noperate in pure advocacy, the outc omes are predetermined. Either \nperson A will win, or person B will win, or both will simply retain their \nviews. When there is inquiry and ad vocacy, these limitations dissolve. \nPersons A and B, by being open to inquire into their own views, make \npossible discovering completely new views. \nWhile mastering the discipline of balancing inquiry and advocacy, I've \nfound that it helps to keep in mind the following guidelines:16 \nWhen advocating your view: \n\u2022 Make your own reasoning explicit (i.e., say how you arrived at \nyour view and the \"data\" upon which it is based)", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2710, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd10d338-e6ad-4cd1-a56c-205a2902b998": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd10d338-e6ad-4cd1-a56c-205a2902b998", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "186", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

MENTAL   MODELS   AND \nTHE   FIFTH   DISCIPLINE \n! have come to believe that system s thinking without mental models || \nlike the DC-3's radial ai r-cooled engine without wi ng flaps. Just as pte \nBoeing 247's engineers had to down size their engine because |hey \nlacked wing flaps, systems thinking  without the discipline of Biental \nmodels loses much of its power. This is why much of our jCUrrent \nresearch at MIT focuses on helping managers to integrate Diental \nmodeling and systems thinking skills . The two disciplines go naturally \ntogether because one focuses on ex posing hidden assumptions and the \nother focuses on how to restructure assumptions to reveal causes of \nsignificant problems. \nAs shown at the outset of the ch apter, entrenched  mental models \nwill thwart changes that could come from systems thinking. Managers \nmust learn to reflect on their curr ent mental models\u2014until prevailing \nassumptions are brought into the open, there is no reason to expect \nmental models to change, and there is little purpose in systems \nthinking. If managers \"believe\" thei r world views are facts rather than \nsets of assumptions, they will not be open to challenging those world \nviews. If they lack skills in inquiring into their and others' ways of \nthinking, they will be limited in ex perimenting col-laboratively with \nnew ways of thinking. Moreover, if there is no established philosophy \nand understanding of mental models  in the organization, people will \nmisperceive the purpose of system s thinking as drawing diagrams \nbuilding elaborate \"models\" of the world, not improving our mental \nmodels. \nSystems thinking is equally important to working with mental \nmodels effectively. Contemporary research shows that most of our \nmental models are system atically flawed. They mi ss critical feedback \nrelationships, misjudge time delays, and often focus on variables that are \nvisible or salient, not necessarily high leverage. MIT's John Stef-man \nhas shown experimentally that players in the beer game, for example, \nconsistently misjudge the delay in receiving orders once placed. Most \nplayers either don't see or don't take into account in their decision \nmaking the critical reinforcing feedbacks that develop when they panic \n(place more orders for beer^whi ch wipes out their supplier's \ninventory, forcing them to lengthen shipping delays, which can lead \nto further panic). Sterman has shown si milar flaws in mental models in a \nvariety of experiments.17", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2512, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "691ea060-7823-4374-b559-e4e88bc6b63a": {"__data__": {"id_": "691ea060-7823-4374-b559-e4e88bc6b63a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "189", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

These \"structures\" will be based on systems \narchetypes such as those presented in Chapter 6. But, thejl would be \nsuited to the particulars of a given organization\u2014its prod! ucts, market, \nand technologies. For example, the particular \"shifting the burden,\" \nand \"limits to growth\" structures for an oil compan|| would differ \nfrom those for an insurance company, but the underiyi ing archetypes \nwould be the same. Such a library should be a naturfdj by-product of \npracticing systems thinking within an organization.  \nUltimately, the payoff from integrating systems thinking and mefl^ tal \nmodels will be not only improving our mental models (what wfl^ think) \nbut altering our ways of thinking: shifting from mental modelf \ndominated by events to mental models that recognize longer-tern^ \npatterns of change and the underlying structures producing those \npatterns. For example, Shell's scenarios not only made the compa-j ny's \nmanagers aware of changes, they shifted the way the managers thought \nabout those changes.

That \ngave those managers a longer-term perspective in which to consider \ntheir strategic options, and it led them to policies which could serve for \nthe rest of the decade. In other words, scenarios helped Shell's \nmanagers take a first step up from the world of events\u2014seeing \npatterns of change.  \nJust as \"linear thinking\" dominates most mental models used for \ncritical decisions today, the learning organizations of the future will \nmake key decisions based on shared understandings of interrelation-\nships and patterns of change.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2196, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0d213f1-0094-4802-bfa8-4f313e0f590a": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0d213f1-0094-4802-bfa8-4f313e0f590a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "190", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

This vision was so compelling that j no man \ncould bear to give it up  and return to slavery. \nA shared vision is not an idea. It is not even an important idea \nsuch as freedom. It is, rather, a fo rce in people's he arts, a force off \nimpressive power. It may be inspir ed by an idea, but once it goes \nfurther\u2014if it is compelling enough to acquire the support of more; \nthan one person\u2014then it is no longer an abstraction. It is palpable. \nPeople begin to see it as if it exists. Few, if any, forces in human \naffairs are as powerful as shared vision. \nAt its simplest level, a shared vision is the answer to the question, \n\"What do we want to create?\" Just as personal visions are pictures or \nimages people carry in their heads and hearts, so too are shared \nvisions pictures that people throughout an organization carry. They \ncreate a sense of commonality that  permeates the organization and \ngives coherence to diverse activities. \nA vision is truly shared when you and I have a similar picture and are \ncommitted to one another having it, not just to each of us, indi-\nvidually, having it.

Personal visions \nderive their power from an individual's deep caring for the vision. \nShared visions derive their power from a common caring. In fact, we \nhave to come to believe that one of the reasons people seek to build \nshared visions is their desire to be connected in an important under-\ntaking. \nShared vision is vital for the lear ning organization because it pro-\nvides the focus and energy for learning. While adaptive learning is \npossible without vision, generative  learning occurs only when people \nare striving to accomplish something that matters deeply to them.

Theodore Vail had a \nvision of universal telephone service that would take fifty years to \nbring about. Henry Ford envisioned common people, not just the \nwealthy, owning their own automobiles. Steven Jobs, Steve Woz-\nniak, and their Apple cofounders saw the power of the computer to \nempower people. It is equally impossible to imagine the rapid ascen-\ndancy of Japanese firms such as Komatsu (which grew from one \nthird the size of Caterpillar to its equal in less than two decades), \nCanon (which went from nothing to matching Xerox's global market \nshare in reprographics in the same time frame), or Honda had they \nnot all been guided by vi sions of global success.2 What is most im-\nportant is that these individuals' visions became genuinely shared \namong people throughout all levels of their companies\u2014focusing the \nenergies of thousands and creating a common identity among enor-\nmously diverse people.  \nMany shared visions are extrinsic\u2014that is, they focus on achieving \nsomething relative to an outsider, such as a competitor. Pepsi's vision \nis explicitly directed at beating Coca-Cola; Avis's vision at Hertz. Yet, \na goal limited to defeating an opponent is transitory. Once the vision \nis achieved, it can easily migrate into a defensive posture of \"protecting \nwhat we have, of not losing our number-one position.\" Such defensive \ngoals rarely call forth the creativity and excitement of building \nsomething new. A master in the ma rtial arts is probably not focused \nso much on \"defeating all others\" as on his own intrinsic inner \nstandards of \"excellence.\" This does not mean that visions must be \neither intrinsic or extrinsic. Both types of vision can coexist.

Maslow observed that in exceptional' teams  \nthe task was no longer separate from the self. . . but rather he \nidentified with this task so strongly that you couldn't define his \nreal self without including that task.6 \nShared visions compel courage so naturally that people don't even \nrealize the extent of their courage. Courage is simply doing whatever is \nneeded in pursuit of the vision. In 1961, John Kennedy articulated a \nvision that had been emerging for many years among leaders within \nAmerica's space program: to have a man on the moon by the end of \nthe decade.7 This led to countless acts of courage and daring.

This posed considerable potentia l embarrassment, since sev-\neral million dollars had already been spent. Instead of trying to jerry- rig \nan expedient solution, they asked NASA to disband the project and \nstart over again. They risked not just their contract but their \nreputation. But no other action was possible. Their entire reason for \nbeing was embodied in one simple vision\u2014having a man on the \nmoon by the end of the decade. They would do whatever it took to \nrealize that vision.  \nApple Computer during the mid-1980s, when the entire small com-\nputer industry rallied behind the IBM PC, persevered with its vision of \na computer which people could understand intuitively, a computer \nwhich represented the freedom to think on one's own. Along the \nway, Apple not only refused the \"sure thing\" opportunity to be a \nleading PC \"clone\" manufacturer, but its leaders gave up an inno-\nvation which they had pioneered: open architecture, where people \ncould add their own components. This did not fit with a computer \nthat was easy to use. Strategically,  the change paid off in a company \nprofile and reputation which even the foremost \"clone\" makers, \nsuch as Compaq, have never been able to equal. Apple's Macintosh \nwas not only easy to use, it became a new industry standard and \nmade having fun a priority in personal computing.  \nYou cannot have a learning organization without shared vision. \nWithout a pull toward some goal which people truly want to achieve, \nthe forces in support of the status quo can be overwhelming. Vision \nestablishes an overarching goal. The loftiness of the target compels \nnew ways of thinking and acting. A shared vision also provides a \nrudder to keep the learning process on course when stresses de-\nvelop. Learning can be difficult, even painful. With a shared vision, we \nare more likely to expose our ways of thinking, give up deeply held \nviews, and recognize personal and organizational shortcomings. All that \ntrouble seems trivial compared with the importance of what we are \ntrying to create. As Robert Fritz puts it, \"In the presence of greatness, \npettiness disappears.\" In the absence of a great dream, pettiness \nprevails.  \nShared vision fosters risk taking and experimentation. \"When you are \nimmersed in a vision,\" says Herman Miller's president Ed Simon, \n\"You know what needs to be done. But you often don't know how \nto do it^ You run an experiment because you think it's going to get \nyou there. Tt doesn't work. New input. New data.

But thi people \nare committed nonetheless.\"  \nLastly, shared vision addresses one of the primary puzzles thn \nhas thwarted efforts to develop systems thinking in management! \n\"How can a commitment to the long term be fostered?'' |  \nFor years, systems thinkers have endeavored to persuade maai \nagers that, unless they maintained a long-term focus, they will be in big \ntrouble. With great vigor we have proselytized the \"better befell worse\" \nconsequences of many interventions, and the \"shifting thl burden\" \ndynamics that result from symptomatic fixes. Yet, I havil witnessed \nfew lasting shifts to longer term commitment and actionf Personally, I \nhave come to feel that our failure lies not in unpersua* siveness or lack \nof sufficiently compelling evidence. It may simptm not be possible to \nconvince human beings rationally to take a lonm term view. People do not \nfocus on the long term because they havq to, but because they want to. \nIn every instance where one finds a long-term view actually oper^ \nating in human affairs, there is a long-term vision at work. The cathel \ndral builders of the Middle Ages labored a lifetime with the fruits o| \ntheir labors still a hundred years in the future. The Japanese believd \nbuilding a great organization is like growing a tree; it takes twenty^1 five \nto fifty years. Parents of young children try to lay a foundatiott of \nvalues and attitude that will serve an adult twenty years hence. Inj all of \nthese cases, people hold a vision that can be realized only oveif the long \nterm.  \nStrategic planning, which should be a bastion of long-term thinking in \ncorporations, is very often reactive and short-term. According toll two \nof the most articulate critics of contemporary strategic planning,] Gary \nHamel of the London Business School and C. K. Prahalad of; the \nUniversity of Michigan:  \nAlthough strategic planning is billed as a way of becoming more \nfuture oriented, most managers, when pressed, will admit that \ntheir strategic plans reveal more  about today's problems than to-\nmorrow's opportunities.8 \nWith its emphasis on extensive analysis of competitors' strengths \nand weaknesses, of market niches an d firm resources, typical strategic \nplanning fails to achieve the one accomplishment that would foster \nlonger range actions\u2014in Hamel's an d Prahalad's terms, setting \"a \ngoal that is worthy of commitment.\"", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2534, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6cea2263-1891-4c4f-a624-369cc60ff753": {"__data__": {"id_": "6cea2263-1891-4c4f-a624-369cc60ff753", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "196", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

Leaders with vision ar e cult heroes. While it is true that \nthere are no formulas for \"how to  find your vision,\" there are \nprinciples and guidelines for building shared vision. There is a discipline \nof building vision that is emerging, and practical tools for working with \nshared visions. Th is discipline extends principles and insights from \npersonal mastery into the world of collective aspiration and shared \ncommitment. \nTHE   DISCIPLINE   OF \nBUILDING   SHARED   V I S I O N  \nENCOURAGING PERSONAL VISION \nShared visions emerge from personal  visions. This is  how they derive \ntheir energy and how they foster commitment. As Bill O'Brien of \nHanover Insurance observes, \"My vision is not what's important to \nyou. The only vision that motivates you is your vision.\" It is not that \npeople care only about their person al self-interest\u2014in fact, people's \npersonal visions usually include dimensions that concern family, \norganization, community, and even  the world. Rather, O'Brien is \nstressing that caring is personal. It is rooted in an individual's own set of \nvalues, concerns, and aspirations. This is why genuine caring about a \nshared vision is rooted in personal visions. This simple truth is lost on \nmany leaders, who decide that their organization must develop a \nvision by tomorrow! \nOrganizations intent on building shared visions continually en-\ncourage members to develop their personal visions. If people don't \nhave their own vision, all they can do is \"sign up\" for someone \nelse's. The result is compliance, never commitment. On the other \nhand, people with a strong sense of personal direction can join to-\ngether to create a powerful synergy toward what I/we truly want. \nPersonal mastery is the bedrock for developing shared visions. \nThis means not only personal vision, but commitment to the truth \nand creative tension\u2014the hallmarks of personal mastery. Shared \nvision can generate levels of creative tension that go far beyond \nindividuals' \"comfort levels.'-Those who will contribute the most \ntoward realizing a lofty vision wi ll be those who can \"hold\" this \ncreative tension: remain clear on the vision and continue to inquire", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2351, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "adceec86-56d7-4247-8380-8524d8916083": {"__data__": {"id_": "adceec86-56d7-4247-8380-8524d8916083", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "197", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

They will be the ones who believe deeply in thei \nability to create their future, beca use that is what they experience \npersonally.  \nIn encouraging personal vision, organizations must be careful IMJ to \ninfringe on individual freedoms. As was discussed in chapter Sj \n\"Personal Mastery,\" no one can give another \"his vision,\" nor eve| \nforce him to develop a vision. However, there are positive action^ that \ncan be taken to create a climate that encourages personal vision The \nmost direct is for leaders who have a sense of vision to commutf nicate \nthat in such a way that others ar e encouraged to share then visions. \nThis is the art of visionary leader ship\u2014how shared vision! are built \nfrom personal visions.  \nFROM PERSONAL VISIONS TO SHARED VISIONS  \nHow do individual visions join to create shared visions? A usefulf \nmetaphor is the hologram, the th ree-dimensional image created by \ninteracting light sources.  \nIf you cut a photograph in half, each part shows only part of the 1 \nwhole image. But if you divide a hologram, each part shows the j \nwhole image intact. Similarly, as you continue to divide up the ho-' \nlogram, no matter how small the divisions, each piece still shows the \nwhole image. Likewise, when a gr oup of people come to share a \nvision for an organization, each person sees his own picture of the \norganization at its best. Each shares responsibility for the whole, not \njust for his piece. But the component \"pieces\" of the hologram are \nnot identical. Each represents the whole image from a different point of \nview. It's as if you were to look through holes poked in a window \nshade; each hole would offer a un ique angle for viewing the whole \nimage. So, too, is each individual's vision of the whole unique. We \neach have our own way of seeing the larger vision.  \nWhen you add up the pieces of a hologram, the image of the whole \ndoes not change fundamentally. After all, it was there in each piece. \nRather the image becomes more intense, more lifelike. When more \npeople come to share a common vision, the vision may not change \nfundamentally. But it b ecomes more alive, more real in the sense of a \nmental reality that people can trul y imagine achieving. They now have \npartners, \"cocreators\"; the vision no longer rests on their shoulders \nalone. Early on, when they are nurturing an individual vision, people \nmay say it is \"my vision.\" But as the shared vision develops, it \nbecomes both \"my vision\" and \"our vision.\"", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2519, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "71e174b1-643e-427a-9f89-5c1f16944813": {"__data__": {"id_": "71e174b1-643e-427a-9f89-5c1f16944813", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "198", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

Of ten, the big picture guiding the \nfirm wasn't even shared\u2014all people needed to know were their \n\"marching orders,\" so that they could carry out their tasks in support \nof the larger vision.

M o s t  \npeople in the organization wouldn't need to understand the vision. \nPeople would simply need to know what was expected of them.\"  \nThat traditional \"top-down\" vision  is not much different from a \nprocess that has become popular in recent years. Top management \ngoes off to write its \"vision statement,\" often with the help of con-\nsultants. This may be done to so lve the problem of low morale or \nlack of strategic direction. Sometimes the process is primarily re-\nflective. Sometimes it incorporates extensive analysis of a firm's \ncompetitors, market setting, and organizational strengths and weak-\nnesses. Regardless, the results are often disappointing for several \nreasons.  \nFirst, such a vision is often a \"one-shot\" vision, a single effort at \nproviding overarching direction an d meaning to the firm's strategy. \nOnce it's written, management assumes that they have now dis-\ncharged their visionary duties. Recently, one of my Innovation As-\nsociates colleagues was explaining to two managers how our group \nworks with vision. Before he could get far, one of the managers \ninterrupted. \"We've done that,\" he said. \"We've already written our \nvision statement.\" \"That's very interesting,\" my colleague responded. \n\"What did you come up with?\" The one manager turned to the \nother and asked, \"Joe, where is that vision statement anyhow?\" \nWriting a vision statement can be a first step in building shared \nvision but, alone, it rarely makes a vision \"come alive\" within an \norganization.  \nThe second problem with top management going off to write their \nvision statement is that the resulting vision does not build on people's \npersonal visions. Often, personal visions are ignored altogether in the \nsearch for a \"strategicjyisiori.\" Or the \"official vision\" reflects only the \npersonal vision of one or two people.

As a result, the new official vision!! also \nfails to foster energy and commitme nt. It simply does not inspire! \npeople. In fact, sometimes, it even generates little passion among the \ntop management team who created it.  \nLastly, vision is not a \"solution to a problem.\" If it is seen in that \nlight, when the \"problem\" of low morale or unclear strategic direct \ntion goes away, the energy behind the vision will go away alsoJ \nBuilding shared vision must be seen as a central element of the daily \nwork of leaders.

As O'Brieii says, \n\"The governing ideas are far more important and enduring than the \nreporting chart and the divisional structure that so often preoc* \ncupyCEOs.\"  \nSometimes, managers expect shar ed visions to emerge from a \nfirm's strategic planning process. But for all the same reasons that \nmost \"top-down\" visioning processes fail, most strategic planning \nalso fails to nurture genuine vi sion. According to Hamel and Pra-\nhalad:  \nCreative strategies seldom emerge from the annual planning ritual. \nThe starting point for next year's strategy is almost always this \nyear's strategy.

Often, \nthey do. But sometimes they emanate from personal visions of indi-\nviduals who are not in positions of authority. Sometimes they just \n\"bubble up\" from people interactin g at many levels. The origin of \nthe vision is much less important than  the process whereby it comes to \nbe shared. It is not truly a \"shared vision\" until it connects with the \npersonal visions of people throughout the organization.  \nFor those in leadership  positions, what is most important is to \nremember that their visions are still personal visions. Just because \nthey occupy a position of leadership does not mean that their personal \nvisions are automatically \"the organization's vision.\" When I hear \nleaders say \"our vision\" and I know  they are really describing \"my \nvision,\" I recall Mark Twain's words that the official \"we\" should be \nreserved for \"kings and people with tapeworm.\"", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2657, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b63abdf-73b8-42d6-9249-600d67d0f375": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b63abdf-73b8-42d6-9249-600d67d0f375", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "200", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

They must also be \nprepared to ask, \"Will you follow me?\" This can be difficult. For a \nperson who has been setting goals all through his career and simply \nannouncing them, asking for support can make him feel very vulner-\nable. \nJohn Kryster was the president of  a large division of a leading \nhome products company who had a vision that his division should \nbe preeminent in its industry. This vision required not only excellent \nproducts but that the company supply the product to their \"cus-\ntomer\" (retail grocers), in a more efficient and effective manner than \nanyone else. He envisioned a unique worldwide distribution system \nthat would get product to the customer in half the time and with a \nfraction of the cost in wastage and reshipments. He began to talk \nwith other managers, with production workers, with distribution \npeople, with grocers. Everyone seemed enthusiastic, but pointed up \nthat many of his ideas could not be achieved because they contra-\ndicted so many traditional policies of the corporate parent.  \nIn particular, Kryster needed the support of the head of product \ndistribution, Harriet Sullivan, who\u2014 while technically Kryster's peer \nin the firm's matrix organization\u2014had fifteen years more experience. \nKryster prepared an elaborate presentation for Sullivan to show her \nthe merits of his new distribution ideas. But for every piece of \nsupporting data he offered, Sullivan had a countering criticism. \nKryster left the meeting thinking that the doubters were probably \nright. \nThen he conceived of a way to test the new system out in only one \ngeographic market. The risk would be less, and he could gain the \nsupport of the local grocery chain which had been especially enthu-\nsiastic about the concept. But what should he do about Harriet Sul-\nlivan? His instincts were just not to tell her. After all, he had the \nauthority to undertake the experiment himself, using his own distri-\nbution people. Yet, he also valued Sullivan's experience and judgment.  \nAfter a week of mulling it over, Kryster went back to ask for \nSullivan's support. This time, though, he left his charts and data at \nhome. He just told her why he be lieved in the idea, how it could \nforge a new partnership with customers, and how its merits could be \ntested with low risk. To his surprise, the crusty distribution chief \nstarted to offer help in designing^he experiment. \"When you came to \nme last week,\" she saictr^you were trying to convince me.

So, who knows, maybe we'll learn \nsomething.\" \nThat was five years ago. Today, John Kryster's innovative distri-\nbution system is used worldwide by almost all the corporation's \ndivisions. It has significantly reduced costs and been part of broad \nstrategic alliances the corporation is  learning to forge with retail \nchains.  \nWhen visions start in the middle of an organization the process of \nsharing and listening is essentially th e same as when they originate at \nthe top. But it may take longer, especially if the vision has implications \nfor the entire organization.  \nBart Bolton was a middle manager in  IS (Information Systems) at \nDigital Equipment Corporation when, back in 1981, he and a small \ngroup of colleagues began to form an idea of Digital as an intercon-\nnected organization. \"A group of us had been together at a workshop, \nand when we came back we just started talking about how we were \ngoing to turn around IS. The fundamental problem as we all saw it \nwas that there simply was no IS vision. Everyone argued about the \n'how to's' but no one knew the 'what.' Yet, we felt we could see an \nend result that was really worth going for. We didn't know exactly \nwhat it would look like, but the idea of tying the organization together \nelectronically just felt 'right.' Given our products and technology we \ncould become one of the first, if not the first large corporation that was \ntotally and completely electronically interconnected.\" The idea was so \nexciting that he couldn't sleep much for several days as he thought \nabout the implications.  \nBut in 1981, no one had any idea how this could be done. \"It was \nsimply beyond the realm of what was possible at that time. We could \ntransfer files between computers, but we couldn't network. There \nwas some networking software under development but there were \nlots of problems with it. Perhaps, if we worked really hard at it we \ncould interconnect ten or twenty machines, but no one even dreamed \nof interconnecting a hundred machines, let alone thousands. Looking \nback, it was like they say about Kennedy when he announced the \n'Man on the Moon' vision\u2014we knew  about 15 percent of what we \nneeded to know to get there.  But we knew it was right.\"  \nBolton and his compatriots had no \"authority\" to pursue the idea, \nbut they couldn't stop thinking about it. In November 1981, he wrote a \nshort paper which he read to all the senior IS people at a staff \nmeeting. In it he said that the organization of the future would involve \nnew IS technologies, would see \"data as a resource just like", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2629, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "772237cd-8e12-4ea3-89b4-0f6a8e4dd683": {"__data__": {"id_": "772237cd-8e12-4ea3-89b4-0f6a8e4dd683", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "202", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

The idea, \"the what,\" started to take hold. Then the \nIS organization created five over lapping programs to tackle the \n\"how to's\": a network program, a data program, an office automation \nprogram, a facilities program, and an applications program. By 1985 \nthe first network was in place. By 1987, over 10,000 computers were on \nline. Today, Digital has over 600 facilities in over 50 countries and they \nare all interconnected.

Out of this listening, new insights \ninto what is possible gradually emerge.  \nListening is often more difficult th an talking, especially for strong--\nwilled managers with definite ideas of what is needed. It requires' \nextraordinary openness and willingn ess to entertain a diversity off \nideas. This  does not imply that  we must sacrifice our vision \"for thi \nlarger cause.\" Rather, we must allow multiple visions to coexist* \nlistening for the right course of ac tion that transcends and unifies all \nour individual visions. As one highly successful CEO expressed it: \n\"My job, fundamentally, is listen ing to what the organization is \ntrying to say, and them making sure that it is forcefully articulated.\"  \nSPREADING VISIONS: ENROLLMENT, \nCOMMITMENT, AND COMPLIANCE10 \nFew subjects are closer to the hear t of contemporary managers than f \ncommitment. Prodded by studies showin g that most American work- < ers \nacknowledge low levels of commitment\" and by tales of foreign f \ncompetitors' committed work for ces, managers have turned to \n\"management by commitment,\" \"hig h commitment work systems,\"'' \nand other approaches. Yet, real commi tment is still rare in today's | \norganizations. It is our experience that, 90 percent of the time, what \u00a7 \npasses for commitment is compliance.  \nToday, it is common to hear managers talk of getting people to \n\"buy into\" the vision. For many, I fear, this suggests a sales process, \nwhere I sell and you buy. Yet, there is a world of difference between \n\"selling\" and \"enrolling.\" \"Selling\" generally means getting someone \nto do something that he might not do if they were in full possession \nof all the facts. \"Enrolling,\" by contrast, literally means \"placing \none's name on the roll.\" Enrollment  implies free choice, while \"being \nsold\" often does not.  \n\"Enrollment is the process,\" in Kiefer's words, \"of becoming \npart of something by choice.\" \"Committed\" describes a state of \nbeing not only enrolled but feeling fully responsible for making the \nvision happen.

A person who was genuinely compliant would never drivej \nmore than fifty-five. A pe rson formally compliant could drive sixty.-] to \nsixty-five because in most states you will not get a ticket so long ! as you \nare below sixty-five. Someone grudgingly compliant would stay below \nsixty-five and complain continually about it. A nonconv pliant driver \nwould \"floor it\" and do everything possible to evade troopers. On the \nother hand, a person who was genuinely committed to a fifty-five mph \nspeed limit would drive that speed even if it were not the legal limit.  \nIn most organizations, most people are in states of formal or gen-\nuine compliance with respect to the organization's goals and ground \nrules. They go along with \"the prog ram,\" sincerely trying to contribute. \nOn the other hand, people in noncompliance or grudging compliance \nusually stand out. They are opposed to the goals or ground rules and \nlet their opposition be known, either through inaction or (if they are \ngrudgingly compliant) through \"malic ious obedience\"\u2014 \"I'll do it just \nto prove that it won't work.\" They may not speak out publicly against \nthe organization's goals, but their views are known nonetheless (They \noften reserve their truest sentiments for the rest room or the cocktail \nlounge.)  \nDifferences between the varying state s of compliance can be subtle. \nMost problematic is the state of genuine compliance, which is often \nmistaken for enrollment or commitment. The prototypical \"good \nsoldier\" of genuine compliance will do whatever is expected of him, \nwillingly. \"I believe in the people behind the vision; I'll do whatever is \nneeded, and more, to the fullest of my ability.\" In his own mind, the \nperson operating in genuine compliance often thinks of himself as \ncommitted. He is, in fact, committe d, but only to being \"part of the \nteam.\"  \nIn fact, from his behavior on the job, it is often very difficult to \ndistinguish someone who is genuinely compliant from someone who", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2378, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4710ade3-0c6a-485f-b950-dc91859aac06": {"__data__": {"id_": "4710ade3-0c6a-485f-b950-dc91859aac06", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "206", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

The answer is deceptively simple. People \nwho are enrolled or committed truly want the vision. Genuinely \ncompliant people accept the vision. They may want it in order to get \nsomething else\u2014for example, to keep their job, or to make their \nboss happy, or to get a^promotion.

People in-\nhis organization had never been asked to commit to anything in their careers. \nAll they had ever been asked to do was be compliant. That was all they \nknew how to do. That was their only mental model. Nd matter what \nhe said about developing  a real vision, about being truly committed, it \ndidn't matter because they heard it within their model of compliance.  \nOnce he grasped this, he shifted tactics. He asked, \"What might \npeople be able to commit to?\" He  initiated a \"wellness program,\" \nreasoning if there was anything to which people might become com-\nmitted, it would be their own health.

The more willing you are for \nhim to make a free choice, the freer he will feel. This can be \nespecially difficult with subordinates, who are often conditioned to \nfeel as though they must go along. But you can still help by \ncreating the time and safety for them to develop their own sense \nof vision.  \nThere are many times when managers need compliance. They may \nwant enrollment or commitment, but cannot accept anything below \nformal compliance. If that is the case, I recommend that you be on \nthe level about it: \"I know you may not agree wholeheartedly with the \nnew direction, but at this juncture it is where the management team \nis committed to heading. I need your support to help it happen.\" \nBeing open about the need for compliance removes hypocrisy. It also \nmakes it easier for people to come to their choices, which may, over \ntime, include enrollment.  \nThe hardest lesson for many managers to face is that, ultimately, \nthere is nothing you can do to get another person to enroll or commit. Enrollment \nand commitment require freedom of choice. The guidelines above \nsimply establish conditions most favorable to enrollment, but they do \nnot cause enrollment. Commitment likewise is very personal; efforts to \nforce it will, at best, foster compliance.  \nANCHORING VISION IN A \nSET OF GOVERNING \nIDEAS  \nBuilding shared vision is actually only one piece of a larger activity: \ndeveloping the \"governing ideas\" for the enterprise, its vision, purpose \nor mission, and core values.

The key is \"creative \ntension,\" the tension between vision  and reality. The most effective \npeople are those who can \"hold\" their vision while remaining \ncommitted to seeing current reality clearly.  \nThis principle is no less true for organizations. The hallmark of a \nlearning organization is not lovely visions floating in space, but a \nrelentless willingness to examine \"what is\" in light of our vision.  \nIBM in the early 1960s, for example, carried out an extraordinary \nseries of experiments in pursuit of a daring vision, a single family of \ncomputers that would make virtually all its previous machines obsolete. \nIn the words of a Fortune writer, IBM staked \"its treasure, its \nreputation, and its position of leadership in the computer field\" on a \nradical new concept: a series of compatible machines serving the \nbroadest possible range of applicat ions, from the most sophisticated \nscientific applications to the relatively small business needs.13 \nJay Forrester once remarked that the hallmark of a great organi-\nzation is \"how quickly bad news travels upward.\" IBM's capacity to \nrecognize and learn from its mistakes proved pivotal during this \nperiod. One of the most discouraging  was an early attempt at a high-\nend machine called \"Stretch,\" introduced in 1960. IBM CEO Tom \nWatson, Jr., effectively killed the project in May 1961, after only a few \nhad been sold. (Watson cut Stretch's hefty $13.5 million price tag \nalmost in half, thereby making it uneconomical to produce.) To him, \nthere was little choice: the machine di d not satisfy its customers, never \nachieving more than 70 percent of its promised specifications. A few \ndays later, Watson spoke candidly to an industry group. \"Our greatest \nmistake in Stretch,\" he said, \"is th at we walked up to the plate and \npointed at the center field stands. When we swung, it was not a homer \nbut a hard line drive to the outfield. We're going to be a good deal \nmore careful about what we promise in the future.\"  \nIndeed they were. Under the direction of many of the same men \nwho had learned from Stretch, IBM introduced the System 360 three \nyears later, which proved to be the platform for its extraordinary \ngrowth over the next ten years.  \nSHARED   VISION AND   \nTHE   FIFTH   DISCIPLINE  \nWHY VISIONS DIE PREMATURELY  \nMany visions never take root and spread\u2014despite having intrinsic \nmerit. Several \"limits to growth\" structures can come into play to \narrest the building of momentum behind a new vision. Understanding \nthese structures can help considerably in sustaining the \"vision-ing \nprocess.\"  \nVisions spread because of a reinforc ing process of increasing clarity, \nenthusiasm, communication and commitment.

Vision paints the \npicture of what we want to create. Systems thinking reveals how we \nhave created what we currently have.  \nIn recent years, many leaders have jumped on to the vision band-\nwagon. They've developed corporate vision and mission statements. \nThey've worked to enroll everyone in the vision. Yet, the expected \nsurges in productivity and competitiveness often fail to arrive. This \nhas led many to become disaffected with vision and visioning. The fad \ncycle has run its course, and the \"baby\" is about to be \"thrown out \nwith the bath water.\"  \nThe problem lies not in shared visions themselves, so long as they are \ndeveloped carefully. The problem lies in our reactive orientation \ntoward current reality. Vision becomes a living force only when \npeople truly believe they can shape their future. The simple fact is that \nmost managers do not experience that they are contributing to creating \ntheir current reality. So they don't see how they can contribute toward \nchanging that reality. Their problems are created by somebody \"out \nthere\" or by \"the system.\"  \nThis attitude can be elusive to pin down because in many organi-\nzations the belief \"We cannot create our future\" is so threatening \nthat it can never be acknowledged. There is a strong \"espoused \nview\" that being a good manager and leader means being \"proactive,\" \nbeing in charge of your own destiny. A person who questions publicly \nthat the organization can achieve what it has set out to do is quickly \nlabeled as \"not on board\" and seen as a problem.  \nYet, this \"can do\" optimism is a thin veneer over a fundamentally \nreactive view, because most organizations are dominated by linear \nthinking, not systems thinking. The dominance of the \"event men-\ntality\" tells people that the name of the game is reacting to change, not \ngenerating change. An event orientation will eventually drive out real \nvision, leaving only hollow \"vision statements,\" good ideas that are \nnever^ taken to heart.  \nBut ai people in an organization begin to learn how existing policies \nand actions are creating their current reality, a new, more fertile soil \nfor vision develops.

There is commonality of purpose, a shared \nvision, and understanding of how to complement one another's \nefforts. Individuals do not sacrifice their personal interests to the \nlarger team vision; rather, the shared vision becomes an extension of their personal visions.

Many of these forces are within the direct \ncontrol of the team members.  \nSecond, there is the n eed for innovative, coordinated action. The \nchampionship sports teams and great jazz ensembles provide \nmetaphors for acting in spontaneous yet coordinated ways. \nOutstanding teams in organizations develop the same sort of \nrelationship\u2014an \"operational trust,\" where each team member \nremains conscious of other team members and can be counted on to \nact in ways that complement each others' actions.  \nThird, there is the role of team members on other teams. For \nexample, most of the actions of seni or teams are actually carried out \nthrough other teams. Thus, a learni ng team continually fosters other \nlearning teams through inculcating the practices and skills of team \nlearning more broadly. \nThough it involves individual skills and areas of understanding, \nteam learning is a collective discipline. Thus, it is meaningless to say that \n\"I,\" as an individual, am mastering the discipline of team learning, just \nas it would be meaningless to  say that \"I am mastering the practice of \nbeing a great jazz ensemble.\"  \nThe discipline of team learning involves mastering the practices of \ndialogue and discussion, the two distinct ways that teams converse. In \ndialogue, there is the free and creative exploration of complex and \nsubtle issues, a deep \"listening\" to one another and suspending of \none's own views. By contrast, in discussion different views are \npresented and defended and there is a search for the best view to \nsupport decisions that must be made at this time. Dialogue and \ndiscussion are potentially complementary, but most teams lack the \nability to distinguish between the two and to move consciously \nbetween them.  \nTeam learning also involves learning how to deal creatively with the \npowerful forces opposing productive dialogue and discussion in \nworking teams. Chief among these are what Chris Argyris calls \n\"defensive routines,\" habitual ways of interacting that protect us and \nothers from threat or embarrassment, but which also prevent us from \nlearning. For example, faced with conflict, team members frequently \neither \"smooth over\" differences or \"speak out\" in a no-holds-\nbarred, \"winner take all\" free-for-all of opinion\u2014what my colleague Bill \nIsaacs calls \"the abstraction wars.\" Yet, the very defensive routines \nthat thwart learning also hold great potential for fostering learning, if \nwe can only learn how to unlock the energy they contain. The inquiry \nand reflection skills introduced in Chapter 10 begin to release this \nenergy, which can then be focused in dialogue and discussion.  \nSystems thinking is especially prone to evoking defensiveness \nbecause of its central message, that  our actions create our reality. \nThus, a team may resist seeing impo rtant problems more systemically. \nTo do so would imply that the problems arise from our own policies \nand strategies\u2014that is \"from us\"\u2014rather than from forces outside \nour control. I have seen many situations where teams will say \"we're \nalready thinking systemically,\" or  espouse a systems view, then do \nnothing to put it into practice, or simply hold stead fastly to the view \nthat \"there's nothing we can do except cope with these problems.\" All \nof these strategies succeed in avoidi ng serious examination of how their \nown actions may be creating the very problems with which they try so \nhard to cope.

Until we have some th eory of what happens when teams \nlearn (as opposed to individuals in teams learning), we will be unable \nto distinguish group intelligence from \"groupthink,\" when individuals \nsuccumb to group pressures for conformity. Until there are reliable \nmethods for building teams that can learn together, its occurrence will \nremain a product of happenstance. This is why mastering team learning \nwill be a critical step in building learning organizations. \nTHE   DISCIPLINE   OF TEAM   LEARNING \nDIALOGUE AND DISCUSSION3 \nIn a remarkable book, Physics and Beyond: Encounters and Conversations, \nWerner Heisenberg (formulator of the famous \"Uncertainty Principle\" \nin modern physics) argues that \"Science is rooted in conversations. The \ncooperation of different people may culminate in scientific results of \nthe utmost importance.\" Heisenbe rg then recalls a lifetime of \nconversations with Pauli, Einstein, Bohr, and the other great figures \nwho uprooted and reshaped traditional physics in the first half of this \ncentury. These conversations, which Heisenberg says \"had a lasting \neffect on my thinking,\" literally gave birth to many of the theories \nfor which these men eventually became famous. Heisenberg's \nconversations, recalled in vivid detail and emotion, illustrate the \nstaggering potential of collaborative learning\u2014that collectively, we can \nbe more insightful, more intelligent than we can possibly be \nindividually. The IQ of the team can, potentially, be much greater \nthan the IQ of the individuals.  \nGiven Heisenberg's reflections, it is perhaps not surprising that a \nsignificant contributor to the emerging discipline of team learning is a \ncontemporary physicist, David Bohm. Bohm, a leading quantum \ntheorist, is developing a theory and method of \"dialogue,\" when a \ngroup \"becomes open to the flow of a larger intelligence.\" Dialogue, it \nturns out, is a very old idea revered by the ancient Greeks and \npracticed by many \"primitive\" societ ies such as the Am erican Indians. \nYet, it is all but lost to the modern world. All of us have had some \ntaste of dialogue\u2014in special conversations that begin to have a \"life \nof their own,\" taking us in directions we could never have imagined \nnor planned in advance.

In \nparticular, this means that, at a quantum theoretical level of accuracy, \nthe observing instrument and the observed object participate in each \nother in an irreducible way. At this level perception and action \ntherefore cannot be separated.\"  \nThis is reminiscent of some of the key features of systems thinking, \nwhich calls attention to how what is happening  is often the \nconsequence of our own actions as guided by our perceptions. Similar \nquestions are raised by the theory of  relativity, as Bohm suggested in \na 1965 book, The Special Theory of Relativity.'' In this book, Bohm \nstarted to connect the systems perspective and mental models more \nexplicitly. In particular, he argued that the purpose of science was not \nthe \"accumulation of knowledge\" (since, after all, all scientific theories \nare eventually proved false) but rather the creation of \"mental maps\" \nthat guide and shape our perception and action, bringing about a \nconstant \"mutual participation between nature and consciousness.\"  \nHowever, Bohm's most distinctive contribution, one which leads \nto unique insights into team learning, stems from seeing thought as \n\"largely as collective phenomenon.\"  Bohm became interested fairly \nearly in the analogy between the collective properties of particles \n(for example, the system wide movements of an \"electron sea\") and \nthe way in which our thought works. Later, he saw that this sort of \nanalogy could throw an important light on the general \n\"counterproductiveness of thought, as can be observed in almost every \nphase of life. \"Our thought is incoherent,\" Bohm asserts, \"and the \nresulting counterproductiveness lies at the root of the world's \nproblems.\u201d. But, Bohm asserts, since thought is to a large degree \ncollective, one  cannot just improve thought individually. \"As with \nelectrons, we  must look on thought as a systemic phenomena arising \nfrom hoiij we interact and discourse with one another.\"  \nThere are two primary types of discourse, dialogue and discussion. \nBoth are important to a team capable of continual generative learning, \nbut their power lies in their synergy, which is not likely to be present \nwhen the distinctions between them are not appreciated.  \nBohm points out that the word \"discussion\" has the same root as  \npercussion and concussion. It suggests something like a \"Ping-Pong \ngame where we are hitting the ball back and forth between us.\" In \nsuch a game the subject of common interest may be analyzed and \ndissected from many points of view provided by those who take part. \nClearly, this can be useful. Yet, the purpose of a game is normally \"to \nwin\" and in this case winning means to have one's views accepted by \nthe group. You might occasionally accept part of another person's view \nin order to strengthen your own, but you fundamentally want your \nview to prevail. A sustained emphasis on winning is not compatible, \nhowever, with giving first priority to coherence and truth.

Dia means through. Logos means the word, or more \nbroadly, the meaning. Bohm suggests that the original meaning of \ndialogue was the \"meaning passing or moving through . . .  a free \nflow of meaning between people, in the sense of a stream that flows \nbetween two banks.\"5 In dialogue, Bohm contends, a group accesses \na larger \"pool of common meaning,\" which cannot be ac cessed \nindividually. \"The whole organizes the parts,\" rather than trying to \npull the parts into a whole.  \nThe purpose of a dialogue is to go beyond any one individual's \nunderstanding. \"We are not trying to  win in a dialogue. We all win if \nwe are doing it right.\" In dialogue, individuals gain insights that simply \ncould not be achieved individually. \"A new kind of mind begins to \ncome into being which is based on the development of a common \nmeaning . . . People are no longer primarily in opposition, nor can they \nsaid to be interacting, rather they are participating in this pool of \ncommon meaning, which is capable of constant development and \nchange.\"  \nIn dialogue, a group explores comp lex difficult issues from many \npoints of view. Individuals suspend their assumptions but they \ncommunicate their assumptions freely.  The result is a free exploration \nthat brings to the surface the full depth of people's experience and \nthought, and yet can move beyond their individual views.  \n\"The purpose of dialogue,\" Bohm suggests, \"is to reveal the \nincoherence in our thought.\" There are three types of incoherence. \n\"Thought denies that it is participative.\" Thought stops tracking \nreality and \"just goes, like a program.\" And thought establishes its own \nstandard of reference for fixing problems, problems which it \ncontributed to creating in the first place.  \nTo illustrate, consider prejudice. Once a person begins to accept a \nstereotype of a particular group, that \"thought\" becomes an active \nagent, \"participating\" in shaping how he or she interacts with another \nperson who falls into that stereotyped class. In turn, the tone of their \ninteraction influences the other person's behavior. The prejudiced \nperson can't see how his prejudice shapes what he \"sees\" and how \nhe acts. In some sense, if he did, he would no longer be prejudiced. To \noperate, the \"thought\" of prejudice must remain hidden to its holder.  \n\"Thought presents itself (stands in front) of us and pretends that it \ndoes not represent.\" We are like actors who forget they are playing a role. \nWe become trapped in the theater of our thoughts (the words \n\"theater\" and \"theory\" have the same root\u2014 theoria \u2014\"to look at\"). \nThis is when thought starts, in Bohm's words, to become \n\"incoherent.\" \"Reality may change but the theater continues.\" We \noperate in the theater, defining problems, taking actions, \"solving \nproblems,\" losing touch with the larger reality from which the theater \nis generated.  \nDialogue is a way of helping people to \"see the representative and \nparticipatory nature of thought [and] ... to become more sensitive to \nand make it safe to acknowledge the incoherence in our thought.\" In \ndialogue people become observers of their own thinking. \nWhat they observe is that their thinking is active. For example, \nwhen a conflict surfaces in a dialogue people are likely to realize that \nthere is a tension, but the tension arises, literally, from our thoughts. \nPeople will say, \"It is our thoughts and the way we hold on to them Comment [PK2]: Page: 106 \nof the river", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3567, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1509f485-652b-4e2a-a314-7bf1d8f91731": {"__data__": {"id_": "1509f485-652b-4e2a-a314-7bf1d8f91731", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "225", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

They begin to take a more creative, less reactive, stance \ntoward their thought.  \nPeople in dialogue also begin to observe the collective nature of \nthought. Bohm says that \"Most thought is collective in origin. Each \nindividual does something with it,\" but originates collectively by and \nlarge. \"Language, for example, is en tirely collective,\" says Bohm. \"And \nwithout language, thought as we know it couldn't be there.\" Most of \nthe assumptions we hold were acquired from the pool of culturally \nacceptable assumptions. Few of us learn truly to \"think for \nourselves.\" He or she who does is sure, as Emerson said long ago, \n\"to be misunderstood.\"  \nThey also begin to observe the difference between \"thinking\" as an \nongoing process as distinct from \"thoughts,\" the results of that \nprocess. This is very important, according to Bohm, to begin \ncorrecting the incoherence in our thinking.  \nIf collective thinking is an ongoing stream, \"thoughts\" are like \nleaves floating on the surface that wash up on the banks. We gather in \nthe leaves, which we experience as \"thoughts.\" We misperceive the \nthoughts as our own, because we fail to see the stream of collective \nthinking from which they arise.  \nIn dialogue, people begin to see the stream that flows between the \nbanks. They begin to \"participate in this pool of common meaning, \nwhich is capable of constant development and change.\" Bohm \nbelieves that our normal processes of thought are like a \"coarse net \nthat gathers in only the coarsest elements of the stream. In dialogue, a \n\"kind of sensitivity\" develops that goes beyond what we normally \nrecognize as thinking. This sensitiv ity is \"a fine net\" capable of \ngathering in the subtle meanings in the flow of thinking. Bohm \nbelieves this sensitivity lies at the root of real intelligence.  \nSo, according to Bohm, collective learning is not only possible but \nvital to realize the potentials of hu man intelligence. \"Through dialogue \npeople can help each other to become aware of the incoherence in \neach other's thoughts, and in  this way the collective thought becomes \nmore and more coherent [from the Latin cohaerere \u2014 \"hanging \ntogether\"]. It is difficult to give a simple definition of coherence, \nbeyond saying that one may sense it as order, consistency, beauty, or \nharmony.  \nThe main point, however, is not to strive for some abstract ideal of \ncoherence. It is rather for all the participants to work together to \nbecome sensitive to all the possible forms of incoherence . Incoherence \nmay be indicated by contra dictions and confusion but more basically \nit is seen by the fact that our thin king is producing consequences that \nwe don't really want.  \nBohm identifies three basic conditions that are necessary for \ndialogue:  \n1. all participants must \"suspend\" their assumptions, literally to \nhold them \"as if suspended before us\"; \n2. all participants must regard one another as colleagues; \n3. there must be a \"facilitator\" who \"holds the context\" of \ndialogue.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3174, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8db66b87-f839-4bb1-b3ec-30ca7ed48cc0": {"__data__": {"id_": "8db66b87-f839-4bb1-b3ec-30ca7ed48cc0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "226", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

Just as \nresistance in an electrical circuit causes the flow of current to generate \nheat (wasted energy), so does the normal functioning of a group \ndisspate energy. In dialogue there is \"cool energy, like a \nsuperconductor.\" \"Hot topics,\" subjects that would otherwise \nbecome sources of emotional discord and fractiousness become \ndiscussable. Even more, they become windows to deeper insights.  \nSuspending Assumptions. To \"suspend\" one's assumptions means \nto hold them, \"as it were, 'hanging in front of you,' constantly \naccessible to questionin g and observation.\" This does not mean \nthrowing out our assumptions, suppressing them, or avoiding their \nexpression. Nor, in any way, does it say that having opinions is \n\"bad,\" or that we should eliminate subjectivism. Rather, it means \nbeing aware of our assumptions and holding them up for examination. \nThis cannot be done if we are defending our opinions. Nor, can it be \ndone if we are unaware of our assumptions, or unaware that our views \nare based on assumptions, rather than incontrovertible fact.  \nBohm argues that once an individual \"digs in his or her heels\" and \ndecides \"this is the way it is,\" the flow of dialogue is blocked. This \nrequires operating on the \"knife edge,\" as Bohm puts it, because \n\"the mind wants to keep moving away from suspending assumptions \n... to adopting non-negotiable and rigid opinions which we then feel \ncompelled to defend.\"  \nFor example, in a recent dialogue session involving a top \nmanagement team of a highly successful technology company (reported \nin detail below), people perceived a deep \"split\" in the organization \nbetween R&D and everyone else, a sp lit due to R&D's exalted role at \nthe company. This split had its roots in the firm's history of a string \nof dramatic product innovations over the past thirty years, literally \npioneering several dramatic new produc ts that in turn became industry \nstandards. Product innovation wa s the cornerstone of the firm's \nreputation in the marketplace. Thus, no one felt able to talk about \nthe \"split,\" even though it was creating many problems. To do so \nmight have challenged the long-cherished value of technology \nleadership and of giving highly creative engineers the autonomy to \npursue their product visions. Moreover, the number-two person in \nR&D was in the meeting.  \nWhen the condition of \"suspending all assumptions\" was \ndiscussed, the head of marketing asked, \"All assumptions?\" When he \nreceived an affirmative answer, he looked perplexed. Later, as the \nsession continued, he acknowledged that he held the assumption that \nR&D saw itself as the \"keeper of the flame\" for the organization, \nand that he further assumed that this made them unapproachable \nregarding market information that might influence product \ndevelopment. This led to the R&D manager responding that he too \nassumed that others saw him in this sight, and that, to everyone's \nsurprise, he felt that this assumption limited his and the R&D \norganization's effectiveness. Both shared these assumptions as \nassumptions, not proven fact. As a result, the ensuing dialogue opened \nup into a dramatic exploration of views that was unprecedented in its \ncandor and its strategy implications.  \n\"Suspending assumptions\" is a lot like seeing \"leaps of abstraction\" \nand \"inquiring into the reasoning behind the abstraction,\" basic", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3528, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "160ebcb7-46e6-4795-83cb-32b7c15dbd72": {"__data__": {"id_": "160ebcb7-46e6-4795-83cb-32b7c15dbd72", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "227", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

Thought continually deludes us into a view \nthat \u201cthis is the way it is.1 \" The team discipline of suspending \nassumptions is an antidote to that delusion.  \nSeeing Each Other as Colleagues. Dialogue can occur only when a group \nof people see each other as colleagues in mutual quest for deeper \ninsight and clarity. Thinking of ea ch other as colleagues is important \nbecause thought is participative. The conscious act of thinking of \neach other as colleagues contributes toward interacting as colleagues. \nThis may sound simple, but it can make a profound difference.  \nSeeing each other as colleagues  is critical to establish a positive \ntone and to offset the vulnerability that dialogue brings. In dialogue \npeople actually feel as if they are building something, a new deeper \nunderstanding. Seeing each othe r as colleagues and friends, while it \nmay sound simple, proves to be extremely important. We talk \ndifferently with friends from the way we do with people who are not \nfriends. Interestingly, as dialogue de velops, team members will find this \nfeeling of friendship developing even towards others with whom they \ndo not have much in common. What is necessary going in is the \nwillingness to consider each other as colleagues. In addition, there is a \ncertain vulnerability to holding assumptions in suspension. Treating \neach other as colleagues acknowledges the mutual risk and establishes \nthe sense of safety in facing the risk.  \nColleagueship does not mean that you need to agree or share the \nsame views. On the contrary, the real power of seeing each other as \ncolleagues comes into play when th ere are differences of view. It is \neasy to feel collegial when everyone  agrees. When there are significant \ndisagreements, it is more diffic ult. But the payoff is also much greater. \nChosing to view \"adversaries\" as \"colleagues with different views\" has \nthe greatest benefits.  \nBohm has expressed doubts about the possiblity of dialogue in \norganizations because of the condition of colleagueship: \"Hierarchy is \nantithetical to dialogue, and it is  difficult to escape hiearchy in \norganizations.\" He asks: \"Can those in authority really 'level' with \nthose in subordinate positions?\" Such questions have several \noperational implications for organizational teams. First, everyone \ninvolved must truly want the benefits of dialogue more than he wants \nto hold onto his privileges of rank.

But that doesn't mean dialogue is always possible in \norganizations. If all participants are no t willing to live by the conditions \nof suspending assumptions and colleagueship, dialogue will not be \npossible.  \nA Facilitator Who \"Holds the Context\" of Dialogue. In the absence of a \nskilled faciltator, our habits of thought continually pull us toward \ndiscussion and away from dialogue. Th is is especially true in the early \nstages of developing dialogue as a team discipline. We take what \n\"presents itself in our thoughts as literal, rather than as a \nrepresentation. We believe in our own views and want them to prevail. \nWe are worried about suspending our assumptions publicly. We may \neven be uncertain if it is psyc hologically safe to suspend \"all \nassumptions\"\u2014\"After all, aren't there some assumptions that I \nmust hold on to or lose my sense of identity?\"  \nThe facilitator of a dialogue session carries out many of the basic \nduties of a good \"process facilitator.\" These functions include helping \npeople maintain ownership of the process and the outcomes\u2014 we \nare responsible for what is happening. If people start to harbor \nreservations that \"so and so\u201d won't let us talk about this, that \nconstitutes an assumption not held in suspension. The facilitator also \nmust keep the dialogue moving. If any one individual should start to \ndivert the process to a discussion when a discussion is not actually \nwhat is called for, this needs to be identified, and the group asked \nwhether the conditions for dialogue are continuing to be met. The \nfacilitator always walks a careful line between being knowledgeable and \nhelpful in the process at hand, and yet not taking on the \"expert\" or \n\"doctor\" mantle that would shift attention away from the members of \nthe team, and their own ideas and responsibility.6 \nBut, in dialogue the facilitator also does something more. His \nunderstanding of dialogue allows him to influence the flow of \ndevelopment simply through participating. For example, after someone \nhas made an observation, the facilitator may say, \"But the opposite \nmay also be true.\" Beyond such reminders of the conditions for \ndialogue, the facilitator's participatio n demonstrates dialogue. The \nartistry of dialogue lies in experiencing the flow of meaning and \nseeing the one thing that needs to be said now. Like the Quakers, \nwho enjoin members to say not simply whatever pops into their heads \nbut only those thoughts that are compelling (and which cause the \nspeaker to quake from the need to speak them), the facilitator says \nonly what is needed' a t  e a c h  p o i n t  i n  t i m e . This deepens others' \nappreciation of dialogue more than any abstract explanation can ever \ndo. \nAs teams develop experience and skill in dialogue, the role of the \nfacilitator becomes less crucial and he or she can gradually become just \none of the participants. Dialogue emerges from the \"leaderless\" group \nonce the team members have developed their skill and under standing. \nIn societies where dialogue is an ongoing discipline, there usually are \nno appointed facilitators. For example, many American Indian tribes \ncultivated dialogue to a high art without formal facili tators. Shamen \nand other wise men had special roles, but the group was capable of \nentering a dialogue on its own.  \nBalancing Dialogue and Discussion.

In dialogue, different \nviews are presented as a means toward discovering a new view. In a \ndiscussion, decisions are made. In a dialogue, complex issues are \nexplored. When a team must reach agreement and decisions must be \ntaken, some discussion is needed. On the basis of a commonly \nagreed analysis, alternative views need to be weighed and a \npreferred view selected (which may be one of the original \nalternatives or a new view that emerges from the discussion). When \nthey are productive, discussions converge on a conclusion or \ncourse of action. On the other hand, dialogues are diverging; they do \nnot seek agreement, but a richer grasp of complex issues. Both \ndialogue and discussion can lead to new courses of action; but \nactions are often the focus of discussion, wh ereas new actions emerge \nas a by-product of dialogue.  \nA learning team masters movement back and forth between \ndialogue and discussion. The ground rules are different. The goals \nare different. Failing to distinguish them, teams usually have neither \ndialogue nor productive discussions.  \nA unique relationship develops among team members who enter \ninto dialogue regularly. They develop a deep trust that cannot help \nbut carry over to discussions. They develop a richer understanding \nof the uniqueness of each person 's point of view. Moreover, they \nexperience how larger understandings emerge by holding one's own \npoint of view \"gently.\" They learn to master the art of holding a \nposition, rather than being \"held by their positions.\" When it is \nappropriate to defend a point of view, they do it more gracefully and \nwith less rigidity, that is without putting \"winning\" as a first priority.  \nMoreover, to a large degree, the skills that allow dialogue are \nidentical to the skills that can make discussions productive rather \nthan destructive. These are the skills of inquiry and reflection, originally \ndiscussed in Chapter 10, \"Mental Models.\" In fact, one of the reasons \nthat dialogue is so important is that it offers a safe environment for \nhoning these skills and for discovering the profound group learning \nthat they can lead to.  \nReflection, Inquiry, and Dialogue. In David Bohm's thinking we hear \ndeep echoes of the \"action science\" approach discussed in Chapter \n10\u2014the importance of making one's views open to influence; and the \nproblem of confusing our mental models with reality. What makes \nBohm's work distinctive is that he is articulating a \"new\" vision of \nwhat can happen in a group that transcends the disabilities identified \nby the action scientists. Moreover, Bohm's dialogue is a team discipline. It \ncannot be achieved individually.  \nPart of the vision of dialogue is the assumption of a \"larger pool of \nmeaning\" accessible only to a group. This idea, while it may appear \nradical at first, has deep intuitive appeal to managers who have long \ncultivated the subtler aspects of collective inquiry and consensus \nbuilding.  \nSuch managers learn early to distinguish two types of consensus: a \n\"focusing down\" type of consensus that seeks the common \ndenominator in multiple individual views, and an \"opening up\" type of \nconsensus that seeks a picture larger than any one person's point of \nview.

Each person's view is a \nunique perspective on a larger reality. If I can \"look out\" through \nyour view and you through mine, we will each see something we might \nnot have seen alone.  \nIf dialogue articulates a unique vision of team learning, reflection \nand inquiry skills may prove essential to realizing that vision. Just as \npersonal vision provides a foundation for building shared vision, so \ntoo do reflection and inquiry skills provide a foundation for dialogue \nand discussion. Dialogue that is grounded in reflection and inquiry skills \nis likely to be more reliable and less dependent on particulars1 of \ncircumstance, such as the ch emistry among team members.  \nDEALING WITH \"CURRENT REALITY\": \nCONFLICT AND DEFENSIVE ROUTINES  \nContrary to popular myth, great teams are not characterized by an \nabsence of conflict. On the co ntrary, in my experience, one of the \nmost reliable indicators of a team that is continually learning is the \nvisible conflict of ideas. In great teams conflict becomes productive. \nThere may, and often will, be conflict around the vision. In fact, the \nessence of the \"visioning\" process lies in the gradual emergence of a \nshared vision from different personal visions. Even when people share \na common vision, they may have many different ideas about how to \nachieve that vision. The loftier the vision, the more uncertain we are \nhow it is to be achieved. The free flow of conflicting ideas is critical \nfor creative thinking, for discovering new solutions no one individual \nwould have come to on his own. Conflict becomes, in effect, part of \nthe ongoing dialogue.  \nOn the other hand, in mediocre teams, one of two conditions \nusually surrounds conflict. Either, there is an appearance of no \nconflict on the surface, or there is rigid polarization. In the \"smooth \nsurface\" teams, members believe that they must suppress their \nconflicting views in order to maintain the team\u2014if each person \nspoke her or his mind, the team would be torn apart by \nirreconcilable differences. The polarized team is one where \nmanagers \"speak out,\" but conflicting views are deeply entrenched. \nEveryone knows where everyone else stands, and there is little \nmovement.  \nFor more than twenty-five years, Chris Argyris and his colleagues \nhave studied the dilemma of why bright, capable managers often fail \nto learn effectively in management teams. Their work suggests that \nthe difference between great team s and mediocre teams lies in how \nthey face conflict and deal with the defensiveness that invariably \nsurrounds conflict. \"We are programmed to create defensive \nroutines,\" says Argyris, \"and  cover them up with further defensive \nroutines . . . This programming occurs early in life.\"7 \nDefensive routines, as noted in Chapter 10, \"Mental Models,\" are \nentrenched habits we use to protect ourselves from the \nembarrassment and threat that co me with exposing our thinking. \nDefensive routines form a sort of protective shell around our Comment [PK3]: Page: 1 \nvzne\u0161en\u011bj\u0161\u00ed \nComment [PK4]: Page: 1 \nobrann\u00fd, zast\u00edrac\u00ed POSTOJ (ref. to JK!!!)", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3298, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "695b6812-7588-4e88-a639-1499c7d59048": {"__data__": {"id_": "695b6812-7588-4e88-a639-1499c7d59048", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "231", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

The source of defensive \nroutines, according to Argyris, is not belief in our views or desire to \npreserve social relations, as we might tell ourselves, but fear of \nexposing the thinking that lies behind our views. \"Defensive \nreasoning,\" says Argyris \"... protects us from learning about the \nvalidity of our reasoning.\"8 For most of us, exposing our reasoning \nis threatening because we are afraid that people will find errors in it. \nThe perceived threat from exposing our thinking starts early in life \nand, for most of us, is steadily reinforced in school\u2014remember the \ntrauma of being called on and not having the \"right answer\"\u2014and \nlater in work. \nDefensive routines are so diverse and so commonplace, they usually \ngo unnoticed.

He felt his company was full of \ncompliant people, not committed visionaries. This was especially \nfrustrating to a man who regards himself as a skilled communicator \nand risk taker. In fact, he is so brilliant at articulating his vision that he \nintimidates everyone around him. Consequently, his view rarely get \nchallenged publicly. People have learned not to express their own views \nand visions around him. While he would not see his own forcefulness \nas a defensive strategy, if he looked carefully, he would see that it \nfunctions in exactly that way.  \nThe most effective defensive rout ines, like that of the forceful \nCEO, are those we cannot see. Ostensibly, the CEO hoped to \nprovoke others into expressing their thoughts. But his overbearing \nbehavior reliably prevented them from doing so, thereby protecting his \nown views from challenge. If expressed as a conscious strategy, the \ndefensiveness is transparent: \"Keep people on the defensive through \nintimidation, so they won't confront my thinking.\" If the CEO saw \nhis strategy presented in such bald terms, he would almost certainly \ndisavow it. The fact that it remains hidden to him keeps it operative. \nProblems caused by defensive routines compound in organizations \nwhere to have incomplete or faulty understanding is a sign of \nweakness or, worse, incompetence.

Their bind is that \nto maintain a facade of confidence they must obscure their ignorance. \nWhichever bind they find themselves in, managers who take on the \nburden of having to know the answers become highly skillful in \ndefensive routines that preserve their aura as capable decision makers \nby not revealing the thinking behind their decisions.  \nSuch defensiveness becomes an accepted part of organizational \nculture. Argyris says, \"Wheneve r I ask individuals . . . what leads \nthem to play political games in organizations? They respond that \nthat's human nature and the nature of organizations. . . . We are the \ncarriers of defensive routines, and organizations are the hosts. Once \norganizations have been infected, they too become carriers.\"9 \nTeams are microcosms of the larger organization, so it is not \nsurprising that the defensive patte rns characteristic of the larger \norganization become embedded in the team. In effect, defensive \nroutines block the flow of energy in a team that might otherwise \ncontribute toward a common vision. To the members of a team \ncaught in their defensive routines, they feel very much like walls\u2014\nblocks and traps that prevent collective learning.  \nTo see how subtle team defensive routines become, consider the \ncase of ATP products: a young division of an innovative, highly \ndecentralized corporation. (The company and individual names are \ndisguised.) Jim Tabor, the thirty-three-year-old division president, \nwas deeply committed to the corporate values of freedom and local \nautonomy. He believed strongly in ATP's products, which were \nbased on a new printed circuit board technology. He was \ntremendously enthusiastic, a natura l cheerleader for his people. In \nturn, the members of his management team worked long hours and \nshared his enthusiasm for their prospects.  \nTheir efforts were rewarded with several years of rapid (30 to 50 \npercent per year) growth in bookings, reaching $20 million in sales in \n1984. However, 1985 witnessed a disastrous collapse in bookings.10 \nTwo major minicomputer manufacturers had become so convinced of \nATP's technology that they had designed the ATP circuit boards into \nnew lines of hardware. But when the 1985 downturn in the \nminicomputer industry hit, the ma nufacturers suspended work on the \nnew lines, leaving ATP with a 50 percent shortfall on projected \nbookings. The business did not bounce back in 1986. Jim Tabor was \neventually removed as division president, although he stayed on as \nengineering manager.  \nWhat went wrong at ATP? Through their enthusiasm, the ATP \nmanagement had locked itself into a strategy that was internally \ninconsistent. The team had set aggre ssive growth targets, in part to \nplease the corporate management, but also because of belief in their \nproduct.

When some of those customers ran \ninto their own business troubles, ATP was doomed.  \nWhy had ATP's management team sanctioned a strategy that left \nthe division so vulnerable? Why did the corporate leadership not \nintervene to insist that  the young division managers diversify their \ncustomer base? At the heart of their problem was a set of defensive \nroutines, embedded in a \"shifting the burden\" structure.  \nAs Argyris says, defensive routines are a response to a problem; \nhere, the problem is a need to learn, arising from a \"learning gap\" \nbetween what is known and what needs to be known. The \n\"fundamental solution\" is inquiry that results eventually in new \nunderstanding and new behavior\u2014that is, learning. But the need for \nlearning also creates a threat. Individuals and teams respond \ndefensively to the threat. This leads to the \"symptomatic solution\": \ndefensive routines that eliminate the learning gap by reducing the \nperceived need for learning.  \nAll the key players at ATP were caught in their own particular \ndefensive routines. Several of ATP' s managers had expressed concern \nabout their reliance on a narrow customer base. When the issue was \nraised in team meetings, everyone agreed it was a problem. But no one \ndid anything about it because everyone was to\u00b0 busy. Driven by their \nchallenging growth targets, ATP's managers had expanded capacity \naggressively and created powerful pressures for new order bookings, \nregardless of where they came from.  \nThe corporate managers to whom Tabor reported were caught in a \nsimilar bind. Here too there was concern about ATP's narrow \ncustomer base. Privately, some of the corporate managers had \nquestions regarding Tabor's ability to build for long-term growth. But \nthese same executives also believed strong in a corporate philosophy of \nnot undermining division presidents' authority to run their own \nbusinesses. They were uncertain how to raise their qualms without \nseeming unsupportive of Tabor's lead ership, so they made only oblique \ncomments or kept quiet.  \nOn the other side of the table, Jim Tabor had questions himself, \nwhich he was reticent to raise in meetings with his superiors.

He wanted to prove his \nabilities. He believed deeply in the busine sses potential and he felt \ncommitted to his fellow managers at ATP. He didn't want to let them \ndown, just as he didn't want to let down his superiors. So he didn't \ntalk about his own uneasiness concerning the aggressive growth targets \nATP had set. \nThe conflicts among ATP's mana gement, corporate management, \nand Tabor were submerged under a su rface of defensive routines and \nthus were never resolved. Within  the team, qualms about the basic \nbusiness strategy were lost in th e pressures to meet the targets \ndictated by the strategy. Tabor's corporate superiors wanted to offer \nhelp but didn't want to appear unsupportive. Tabor needed help but \nhe didn't want to appear unconfid ent. Behind the surface of mutual \nsupport, camaraderie, and \"all for one\" spirit, lay ways of dealing with \nconflict that ultimately  resulted in outcomes contrary to everyone's \nintentions. \nThe more effective defensive routines are, the more effectively they \ncover up underlying problems, the less effectively these problems are \nfaced, and the worse the problems te nd to become. The real need to \nlearn didn't go away at ATP. By avoiding the real problems \u2014how to \nbuild up a broad customer base\u2014they allowed the problems to get \nworse. As in all shifting the burden structures, the more teams turn to \ndefensive routines, the more they come to rely on them. \"The \nparadox,\" writes Argyris, \"is that when [defensive routines] succeed in \npreventing immediate pain they also prevent us from learning how \nto reduce what causes the pain in the first place.\"11 \nAs Argyris also says, defensive routines are \"self-sealing\"\u2014they \nobscure their own existence. This comes in large measure because we \nhave society-wide norms that say that we should be open and that \ndefensiveness is bad. This makes it difficult to acknowledge defensive \nroutines, even if we know that we are being defensive. If Tabor's \ncorporate superiors had stated their strategy explicitly, it would have \nsounded something like the following: \"We are avoiding questioning \nJim's abilities, to avoid having to face the conflict that would ensue \nand to maintain an appearance of support.\" If such a strategy were \nstated, they would surely have eschew ed it. Likewise, if Tabor had said, \n\"I am avoiding expressing my doubts about how we are managing \nbecause I am afraid that it will make  me look weak or incompetent,\" his \ndefensive strategy would have been unsustainable. But no one voiced \nthese feelings because of the same basic fears that made everyone \ntake up the defensive routines in the first place.  \nIf you can't easily state defensive routines, where is the leverage for \nreducing them? In most shifting the burden structures, there are two \npossible areas of leverage: (1) weaken the symptomatic solution and (2) \nstrengthen the fundamental solution. One way of weakening the \nsymptomatic solution is diminishing the emotional threat  that prompts \nthe defensive response in the first place. For example, if Tabor had \nfelt comfortable about acknowledging his own uncertainty in front of \nhis corporate superiors, or if they had felt comfortable raising their \nquestions, each would have been less inclined to avoiding fundamental \nquestioning of ATP's strategy.12 Learning how to deal with defensive \nroutines when they arise would also weaken the symptomatic solution. \nTo retain their power, defensive routines must remain undiscussable. \nTeams stay stuck in their defensive routines only when they pretend Comment [PK8]: Page: 118 \n missing word - sorry \nComment [PK9]: Page: 1 \nvyhnout se, eliminovat", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3722, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc490941-8aad-4bcb-9ee4-b79bf4aa45e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc490941-8aad-4bcb-9ee4-b79bf4aa45e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "235", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

Trying to \"fix\" \nanother person's defensive routine is almost guaranteed to backfire. \nFor example, try asking someone why he has been behaving \ndefensively. Universally, the first response is a protest: \"Me? I'm not \nbehaving defensively!\" By focusing attention on the other person, \nthe \"confronter\" has taken no responsibility for the situation. It \nalways takes two (or more) to dance. If we perceive a defensive \nroutine operating, it is a good bet that we are part of it. Skillful \nmanagers learn to confront defensiveness without producing more \ndefensiveness.  \nThey do so by self-disclosure and by inquiring into the causes of \ntheir own defensiveness. For example, they might say something \nsuch as, \"I notice that I am feeling threatened by this new proposal. \nYou may be also. Could you help me in seeing where this uneasiness is \ncoming from?\" Or, \"Is what I am saying making sense? I think that \nthe way I am communicating makes me seem closed and adamant on \nthis point. But I'd like to hear your view so that we can get a more \nobjective picture.\" (Obviously, it is the spirit of the statements not \ntheir specifics that matter.) Both of these statements acknowledge the \nspeaker's experience of uneasiness and invite a joint inquiry into its \ncauses.  \nThe skills for defusing defensiv e routines are essentially the same \nskills for strengthening the \"fundamental solution\" in the shifting \nthe burden structure\u2014the skills of reflection and mutual inquiry.

What is \nrequired, not surprisingly, is a vision of what we really want, both in \nterms of business results and how we want to work together, and a \nruthless commitment to telling the truth about our \"current reality.\" In \nthis sense, team learning and building shared vision are sister \ndisciplines. They naturally go together to build \"creative tension\" in a \nteam.  \nIn the presence of a genuinely shared vision, defensive routines \nbecome just another aspect of \"current reality.\" Like the \"structural \nconflicts\" discussed in the chapter on personal mastery, they derive \ntheir power from being unrecognized. A team committed to the truth \nhas unique powers to surface and acknowledge their own \ndefensiveness. Then the defensive routines can actually become a \nsource of energy rather than inertia.  \nDefensive routines can become a surprising ally toward building a \nlearning team by providing a signal  when learning is not occurring. \nMost of us know when we are bein g defensive, even if we cannot \nfully identify the source or pattern of our defensiveness.

When we are feeling defensive, seeking to \navoid an issue, thinking we need to protect someone else or \nourselves\u2014these are tangible signals that can be used to reestablish a \nclimate of learning. But we must le arn to recognize the signals and \nlearn how to acknowledge the defensiveness without provoking \nmore defensiveness.  \nDefensive routines may signal especially difficult and especially \nimportant issues. Often, the stronger the defensiveness, the more \nimportant the issue around which people are defending or protecting \ntheir views. If these views can be brought out productively, they \nmay provide windows onto each other's thinking. When defensiveness \nis met by self-disclosure and inquiry balanced with advocacy, team \nmembers begin to see more of each other's thinking.  \nLastly, as team members learn how to work with  rather than \nagainst  their defensive routines, they build confidence that \"we are \nsenior to our defensiveness.\" Defensive routines pull down team \nmembers. They drain energy and sap people's spirit. When a team \nsees itself transcend blocks that have been preventing learning, \nblocks which many felt were inevitable\u2014as Argyris observed, \"the \nnature of organizations\"\u2014they gain tangible experience that there \nmay be many aspects of their reality that they have the power to \nchange.  \nIn medieval times, alchemy was a symbol for transformation of \nwhat is most common (lead) into what is most precious (gold). So, too, \ndo learning teams practice a special form of alchemy, the \ntransformation of potentially divisive conflict and defensiveness into \nlearning. They do this through their vision and skill. Through dialogue, \nteam members gain tangible experience of the larger intelligence that \ncan operate. This experience stren gthens the team members' vision \nof how they might operate. But unless the team also builds the skills for \nseeing rather than obscuring current reality, their capacity for learning \nwill be unreliable. Without reflection and inquiry skills, they will get \nthrown off course when defensiveness arises\u2014their learning will \ndepend on circumstances.  \nIt is not the absence of defensiveness that characterizes learning \nteams but the way defensiveness is faced. A team committed to \nlearning must be committed not only to telling the truth about what's \ngoing on \"out there,\" in their business reality, but also about what's \ngoing on \"in here,\" within the team itself. To see reality more \nclearly, we must also see our strategies for obscuring reality.  \nThe power and insight that start to emerge when this happens are \nconsiderable. In effect, defensive routines are like safes within which we \n\"lock up\" energy that could be dire cted toward collective learning. As \ndefensiveness becomes \"unlocked,\" that insight and energy are \nreleased, becoming available for building shared understanding and \nadvancing toward what the team members truly want to create.  \nTHE MISSING LINK: PRACTICE  \nIt cannot be stressed too much that team learning is a team skill.

Learning teams learn how to learn \ntogether.  \nIf anything, team skills are more challenging to develop than \nindividual skills. This is why learning teams need \"practice fields,\" ways \nto practice together so that they can develop their collective learning \nskills. The almost total absence of meaningful \"practice\" or \n\"rehearsal\" is probably the predominant factor that keeps most \nmanagement teams from bein g effective learning units.  \nWhat exactly is \"practice\"? Donald Schon, in his book The Reflective \nPractitioner, identifies the essential principles of practice as \nexperimentation in a \"virtual world.\" A virtual world is a \"constructed \nrepresentative of the real world.\" It can be as simple as the architects' \nsketchpad:  \nHere they can draw and talk their moves in a spatial-action language, \nleaving traces which represent the forms of buildings on the site. \nBecause the drawing reveals qualities and relations unimagined \nbeforehand, moves can function as experiments . . . [discovering] that \nbuilding shapes do not fit the slope and that . . . classrooms are too \nsmall in scale.(14) \nThe essence of a virtual world is the freedom it allows for \nexperimentation. The pace of action  can be slowed down or speeded \nup. Phenomena that occur very rapidly can be stretched out over \ntime to study more carefully. Phenomena that stretch out over very \nlong periods can be speeded up to  see more clearly the consequences \nof particular actions. No move is irreversible. Actions that cannot be \nreversed or taken back and redone in the real setting can be redone \ncountless times. Changes in the environment can be eliminated, \neither completely or partially. Complexity can be simplified by \nuncoupling variables that are interlocked in reality.  \nThe manipulations that Schon describes in virtual worlds of the \narchitects and other professionals match precisely what happens \nwhen the basketball team or the symphony orchestra practices. They \nvary the pace of the action by slowing down the music, by running \nplays in slow motion. They isolate components and simplify the \ncomplexity\u2014by playing individual sections, by running plays without a \ncompetitor. They reverse what is, in the real performance, \nirreversible\u2014they replay the same section over and over, they rerun \nthe play over and over.  \nInterestingly, the few examples in business of teams which learn \nconsistently over a long period of time seem to be exactly those \nsettings where effective virtual worlds operate. For instance, modern \nadvertising practice is based on the concept of a creative team, where \nan account supervisor, art director, and copywriter work closely \ntogether, often for years. So clos e are these teams that teammates \noften switch agencies togeth er, rather than break apart. What makes \nadvertising teams special is that they practice together, as consistently \nand intensively as the members of  a basketball team do. They \nbrainstorm ideas, and then ex periment with them, testing them in \nstoryboards or mock-ups, and eventually presenting them\u2014 first to \nhigher-ups in the agency, then to the client. \nTeam learning requires that type of regular practice. But \nmanagement teams, by and large, are bereft of it.

But \nthere is nothing akin to a storyboard or a rehearsal. The main product \nof the team's work is decisions about specific situations, often \ndebated and decided under great time pressure, and each decision is \nfinal as soon as it is made. There is no experimentation with decisions; \nworse still, there is little opportunity to form reasoned assessments of \nthe wisdom of different decisions,  and there is no opportunity to \nstep back, as a team, and reflect on how we might arrive at better \ndecisions together. \nLEARNING   HOW   \"TO   PRACTICE\" \nToday, the discipline of team le arning is, I believe, poised for a \nbreakthrough because we  are gradually learning how \"to practice.\" In \nparticular, two distinct \"practice fields\" are developing. The first \ninvolves practicing dialogue, so that a team can begin to develop its \njoint skill in fostering a team IQ that exceeds individual IQs. The \nsecond involves creating \"lea rning laboratories\" and \"micro-\nworlds,\" (Chapter 17), computer-supported environments where \nteam learning confronts the dynamics of complex business realities. \nDialogue sessions allow a team to co me together to \"practice\" dialogue \nand develop the skills it demands. The basic conditions for such a \nsession include: \n1. having all members of the \"team\" (those who need one another \nto act) together \n2. explaining the ground rules of dialogue \n3. enforcing those ground rules so that if anyone finds himself \nunable to \"suspend\" his assumptions, the team acknowledges \nthat it is now \"discussing\" not \"dialoguing\" \n4. making possible, indeed encouraging, team members to raise the \nmost difficult, subtle, and conflictua l issues essential to the team's \nwork \nWe think of dialogue sessions as \"practice\" because they are \ndesigned to foster team skills. Yet, the practical re sults of such sessions \ncan be significant. \nRecently, the management team at DataQuest Drives, a leading \nmanufacturer of disk drives and related computer peripherals held \nsuch a session.15 As mentioned earlier, DataQuest is a firm with a well-\nestablished market image for technolo gical innovation. In addition to \nbeing dominated internally by R&D, DataQuest's charismatic founder \nrecently retired after shepherding the firm's successful growth for \nmore than thirty years. After a year of spotty business success with the \nnew management in place, things  were rocky. DataQuest's new \npresident, John MacCarthy, faced th e daunting challenge of filling the \nshoes of a legend, facing more difficult business conditions than the \nlegend ever had to worry about (the entire market was overbuilt), and \nwith a team of strong players who had not yet begun to work as a \nwhole. \nOn the heals of a tumultuous reorganization, MacCarthy's \nmanagement team came together for two days with the following \ninvitation from the president: Comment [PK12]: Page: 1 \nmana\u017eersk\u00fd akceler\u00e1tor PKL \nComment [PK13]: Page: 1 \nnerovnom \u011brn\u00fd, nevyrovnan\u00fd", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3044, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "176ca72b-e075-4fe7-90cc-62812c669d4d": {"__data__": {"id_": "176ca72b-e075-4fe7-90cc-62812c669d4d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "239", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

I believe there is opportunity for us to improve our \nunderstanding and the wa y we implement change. \nThe session is intended to be the first in a series of dialogues to \nhelp us clarify the assumptions, programs, and responsibilities \nunderlying the implementation of our key strategies. We have \nthe view that only through the input from a larger group can we \nexecute our changes and programs in a coherent and \nunambiguous way. The purpose of this two-day session is to \ngain understanding of each other's view by thinking through the \nmajor issues facing us at this time. \nThis session is not an attempt to make decisions as much as \na setting to examine directions and the assumptions \nunderlying them.  \nW e  h a v e  a  s e c o n d  g o a l .

In this dialogue \nwe should consider ourselves e quals who still have substantive \nknowledge of the situations we are considering. \nWe see this meeting as the first step toward establishing \nongoing substantive dialogue among us. Our experience begins \nto show that to engage in dialog ue takes practice , and we should \nexpect to be learning how to do this in this session. Several \nground rules are helpful and we invite you to participate by \nfollowing these as much as you can. \nSuggested Ground Rules  \n1. Suspension of assumptions. Typically people take a position \nand defend it, holding  to it. Others take up opposite positions \nand polarization results. In this session, we would like to \nexamine some of our assumptions underlying our direction \nand strategy and not seek to defend them. \n2. Acting as colleagues. We are aski ng everyone to leave his or her \nposition at the door. There will be no particular hierarchy in this \nmeeting, except for the facilitator, who will, hopefully, keep us on \ntrack. \n3. Spirit of inquiry. We would like to have people being to \nexplore the thinking behind thei r views, the deeper assumptions \nthey may hold, and the evidence they have that leads them to \nthese views. So it will be fair to begin to ask other questions \nsuch as \"What leads you to say or believe this?\" or \"What \nmakes you ask about this?\" \nOver the two days, many previously closed subjects became open, \nblocks to communication came down, and rifts were healed.

Both are deeply  proud of what DataQuest has \nachieved. Both believe deeply in its commitment to \"participative \nmanagement\" and its related ideals about people and the \norganization. Yet, both are caught in a conflict that epitomizes the \nforces that are restraining DataQuest Drives' continuing growth. R&D \nis viewed as artists, designers, creators. Marketing sees itself, and is \nseen by others, as \"the great unwashed,\" dealing in the messy world \nof sleazy dealers' bargain making (who have no particular loyalty to \nDataQuest), price discount ing, and irate customers.  \nThe \"two cultures\" of R&D and Marketing are reflected in \nnumerous organizational conflicts. For example, both Grauweiler \nand Smyth have their own product budgets. Grauweiler's is for new \ndevelopment. Smyth's is for acqui sitions, buying smaller companies \nwhose products round out DataQu est's and make the firm, in \nSmyth's eyes, more competitive in the marketplace. There is no \nintegrated product plan uniting the two. Marketing felt compelled to \nthis \"end run\" because they saw R&D as being unresponsive to the \nfull range of customer needs. R&D, it turns out, saw, itself being cut \nout of important product decisions. As the dialogue unfolded, \nGrauweiler expressed a level of co ncern that came as a surprise, \nbecause people assumed that R&D valued its autonomy:  \nGRAUWEILER : Let me offer a way to look  at the issue of product \nstrategy, which I submit today is being viewed as sort of an arm \nwrestle. We have, in effect, amassed a two pronged product \nstrategy. We've not been overt or clear about it. My evidence is that \nwe've not really brought the full competencies of the organization \ntogether to understand what amounts really to Data Quest's \nmake/buy decision on product. That being the case, we have one \ngroup of people spending money on some product programs with a \ncertain level of confidence and another group of people spending \nmoney on product programs with a different view. And \"never the \ntwo shall meet.\" That's just insane to me. There should be a \nsingular, overriding product strategy that supports R&D and \nmarketing. And, beneath that, come any number of make/buy \ndeci sions ...\"  \nMACCARTHY : I think we all fundamentally agree with that.  \nGRAUWEILER : Could I submit that we are telegraphing the opposite.  \nOTHERS : Yes. \nGRAUWEILER : It's more acute than just not doing it well. We're being \nperceived as doing the opposite. \nSMYTH : I was trying to get back and think of the rationale for why the \nmake versus buy decision is a different and separated decision. At \nthis point, it appears disjointed . . . One is, in my view, problem-\nsolving, research-driven focus. The DataQuest label . . .  On the \nother hand, in other products that DataQuest has not directed \nresources to, we are doing that  through \"buy.\" We're acquiring \nthe access to that in a way other than DataQuest's research . . . \nbecause it is more market reactive than fundamental problem-\nsolution driven. And we don't want to pollute, you might say, the \npurity of what it is we want to do with research. . . .  \nPHILLIPS (HUMAN RESOURCE VP): I think that has put us in conflict.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3361, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9a873ae-cebc-4139-8170-7f039484e14b": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9a873ae-cebc-4139-8170-7f039484e14b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "241", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

That's the problem. That's the prejudgment \nthat I don't tolerate. How about the people who you're depending \nupon having some say in it? And don't protect my purity for me.  \nSMYTH : Well . . .I'm not uncomfortable with the rationale for what \nwe have done. There may be a better way to do it. But I do think \nthat, at some point in our history here, we decided not to invest in \nvertical storage disk files . . . just conventional junk that the market \nwill buy that's not innovative. It's not interesting . . . And we \nwanted to allocate our finite resources and talent to what \nDataQuest's image is, which is research, innovative, product-driven \n. . .  So we went out and acquired the more pedestrian stuff.  \nPHILLIPS : If we are just blueskying it today, let me tell you what has \nalways confused me. And I'm laying that on both marketing and \nR&D. \"Research-driven product company\" is how we've always \ntalked about ourselves. And when we talk that way, it kind of puts \nus to say that any product that doesn't have the DataQuest \ninvestment in innovative research  is outside DataQuest. Somehow \nor another, we've structured ou rselves that way and become in \ncompetition . . .  \nMACCARTHY : That's one definition of research-based. Do you know \nthe other definition? The other definition is that nobody else in \nDataQuest does any research and de velopment if it's not on a new \nproduct.  \nGRAUWEILER : I don't like that one either.  \nPHILLIPS : You hit point number two, because I was saying to myself \n... i f  y o u  t a k e  t h e  o v e r r i d i n g  d i r e c t i o n  s t a t e m e n t  a s  i t  i s  on the \nboard, whether or not your decision is to make or buy, it still has to \nbe research- and development-driven. It's got to be innovative . . .  \nMACCARTHY : I think we're onto something here. What we're saying is \nthat the company in the past has been locked in. The only thing that \nmade us great was product research and development. So we're \nhaving this incredible tension here. I would suggest that we \nbought subsidiaries to launch us . . .  I think the dilemma that \nyou're [Grauweiler] helping us to see is that . . . we should be \noffering whatever products the customer fundamentally needs. But \nthen there's the other side that says, \"But if it come out of \nDataQuest's research, it has to carry a DataQuest label.\" What \nyou're saying is that's not true. That [what label to put on] ought \nto be a marketing decision based on what positioning you're trying \nto do. That's very helpful . . . because most of us have felt that if \na product is not going to have a DataQuest label on it, you won't \ndevelop it in the first place.  \nHADLY (MANUFACTURING VP): But that's also making a statement that \nthe entire company is research-driven, not just R&D, that other \ninnovative ideas including product can come from other sides of \nthe company. It doesn't all have to funnel through R&D.  \nGRAUWEILER : That's fine, but I don't know why that needs to be said. \nI'm not challenging yoVatalL But i think there's an inference here \nagain that troubles me. I feel saddled representing the R&D legacy \nof the past, which I don't buy into.

Bohm's primary critique of contemporary thought, the \n\"pollution\" in the stream of collective thinking, is \"fragmentation,\" the \n\"tendency of thought to  break things apart.\" \nLikewise, the approach taken by le arning teams to defensive routines \nis intrinsically systemic. Rather than  seeing the defensiveness in terms \nof others' behavior, the leverage lies  in recognizing defensive routines \nas joint creations and to find our own role in creating and sustaining \nthem. If we only took for defensive routines \"out there,\" and fail to \nsee them \"in here\" our efforts to deal with them just increase the \ndefensiveness 1 \nThe tools of systems thinking are al so important beca use virtually all \nthe prime tasks of management te ams\u2014developing strategy, shaping \nvisions, designing policy and organizational structures\u2014involve \nwrestling with enormous complexity . Furthermore, this complexity \ndoes not \"stay put.\" Each situation is in a continual state of flux. \nPerhaps the single greatest liability of management teams is that they \nconfront these complex, dynamic real ities with a language designed for \nsimple, static problems. Management consultant Charles Kiefer says it \nthis way: \"Reality is composed of multiple-simultaneous, \ninterdependent cause-effect-cause relationships. From this reality, \nnormal verbal language extracts simple, linear cause-effect chains. \nThis accounts for a great deal of why managers are so drawn to low \nleverage interventions.\" For example, if the problem is long product \ndevelopment times we hire more en gineers to reduce times; if the \nproblem is low profits we cut costs; if the problem is falling market \nshare we cut price to boost share.  \nBecause we see the world in simple obvious terms, we come to \nbelieve in simple, obvious solutions. This leads to the frenzied \nsearch for simple \"fixes\", a task that preoccupies the time of many \nmanagers. John Manoogian, director of Ford's \"Project Alpha,\" \nsays, \"The find and fix mentality results in an endless stream of short-\nterm fixes, which appear to make problems go away, except they keep \nreturning. So, then, we go off and fix them again. The find and fix \nexperts will go on forever.\"  \nThe problems compound in a diverse,  cross-functional team such as \na management team.

This makes it virtually impossible for a shared \npicture of the system as a whole to emerge in normal conversation.

Today, the only universal language \nof business is financial accounting . But accounting deals with detail \ncomplexity not dynamic complexity. It offers \"snapshots\" of the \nfinancial conditions of a business, but it does not describe how those \nconditions were created. Today, there are several tools and \nframeworks that provide alternatives to traditional accounting as a \nbusiness language. These include comp etitive analysis, \"Total Quality,\" \nand, though much less widely used, scenario methods such as those \ndeveloped at Shell.16 But none of these tools deals with dynamic \ncomplexity very well or at all.  \nThe systems archetypes offer a potentially powerful basis for a \nlanguage by which management teams can deal productively with \ncomplexity. As teams such as the one at ATP master the basic \narchetypes, their conversations will naturally become more and more \nconversations about underlying stru ctures and leverage and less and \nless predominated by crises and short-term \"fixes.\" \nIf the ATP management team had be en fluent in the language of \nthe systems archetypes, the implic ations of their narrow-minded \nfocus on meeting monthly and quarterl y sales targets would have been \ninescapable. In particular, they would have realized that when they \nincreased pressures to meet sales targets, they communicated very clearly to \nthe salesforce the message: \"When push comes to shove, it's better to \npursue the low-risk additional sale to a current customer than the \nhigh-risk effort to create a new customer.\" This \"shifted the burden\" \nfrom building their customer base to making more sales to existing \ncustomers, thereby making them more dependent on a few key \ncustomers. \nIf the corporate managers had likew ise been able to see and discuss \nthis structure, they would have been able to surface their concerns \nabout Jim Tabor's management more effectively. Rather than wrestling \nwith how they could raise issues that  might appear critical of Tabor's \nmanagement skills and unsupportive, they could have simply laid out \nthe two feedback processes and inquired into how any of them could be \nmore confident that the fundamen tal solution of broadening the \ncustomer base was receiv ing adequate attention. \nWhen the systems archetypes are used in conversations about \ncomplex and potentially conflictual management issues, reliably, they \n\"objectify\" the conversation. The conversation becomes about \"the \nstructure,\" the systemic forces at  play, not about personalities and \nleadership styles. Difficult questions ca n be raised in a way that does not \ncarry innuendos of management inco mpetence or implied criticism. \nRather, people are asking: \"Is the burd en shifting to selling to current Comment [PK14]: Page: 1 \nsc\u00e9n\u00e1\u0159e prob\u00edran\u00e9 v dal\u0161\u00edch kapitol\u00e1ch \nComment [PK15]: Page: 1 \nstrk", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3698, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01f627c5-204d-4cf0-a8e1-caf6d498f5d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "01f627c5-204d-4cf0-a8e1-caf6d498f5d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "245", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

And \nthey value doing it with others. You may recall that a cornerstone of \nthe discipline of personal mastery (Cha pter 9) is that people have an \ninnate sense of purpose and that, when people reflect on what they \ntruly want, most discover that aspe cts of their vision concern their \nfamilies, their communities, their organizations, and for some their \nworld. These are still \"personal visions\" in the sense that they emanate \nfrom an individual, but they reach far beyond the individual's self-\ninterest in the narrow sense.  \nWhen organizations foster shared visions, they draw forth this \nbroader commitment and concern. Building shared vision, as dis-\ncussed in Chapter 11, leads people to acknowledge their own larger \ndreams and to hear each other's dreams. When managed with sensi-\ntivity and persistence, building shared vision begins to establish a \nsense of trust that comes naturally with self-disclosure and honestly \nsharing our highest aspirations. Getting started is as simple as sitting \npeople in small circles and asking them to talk about \"what's really \nimportant\" to them. Invariably, people comment, \"I never knew \nthis about Joe, and we've been work ing together for five years,\" or \n\"Knowing what I now know about you, my attitude toward working \ntogether is completely changed.\" When people begin to state and \nhear each other's visions, the foundation of the political environment \nbegins to crumble\u2014the belief that all we care about is self-interest. \nOrganizations that fail to foster genuinely shared visions, or that foist \nunilateral visions on their members and pretend that they are shared, \nfail to tap this broader commitment. Though they may decry internal \npolitics, they do nothing to nurture a nonpolitical environment.  \nAs a part of building shared vision, the process of committing to \nlive by certain basic values also undermines internal politics. Once, as \npart of a three-day visioning session for the management team of a \nBoston area technology firm, the question of honesty came up. The \ngroup had casually identified \"hon esty and forthrightness in all com-\nmunications\" as one of their operating ground rules. The management \nteam had developed a vision they were beginning to get really excited \nabout, when one of the senior salespeople commented offhandedly, \n\"Of course, we don't mean that we will be honest to our customers.\"  \nThe entire process ground to a halt. The group reconsidered what \nthey meant by \"commitment to honesty and forthrightness in all \ncommunications.\" The president broke the silence by stating, \"Yes. \nFor me, this means being completely honest with our customers.\"", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2738, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "91540771-c58a-4e4c-b04f-76a303dbd6fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "91540771-c58a-4e4c-b04f-76a303dbd6fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "251", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

Sadly, this view often turns out \nto be naive.

As \nO'Brien says, \"How many managers describe an issue the same way at \na work team meeting at 10 A.M. as they do when they are home or \nhaving a drink with friends that same evening?\"  \nSecondly, on a deeper level, no one's view is changing or being \naffected. After stating our opinions, if we don't agree, we simply \nconclude that \"people are different\" and go our separate ways. If \none decision representing the group must be made, it either represents \na watered-down \"consensus\" or the preference of the one or two \nwhose opinion counts most. Participative openness may lead to more \n\"buy-in\" on certain decisions, but by itse lf it will rarely lead to better \nquality decisions because it does not influence the thinking behind \npeople's positions. In the terms of personal mastery, it focuses purely \non the \"means\" or process of interacting, not on the \"results\" of that \ninteraction. For example, people might say, \"That was a great meeting. \nEverybody got to express his views,\" instead of judging the quality of \ndecisions and actions taken over time. This is why many managers find \nparticipative management wanting. As one disgruntled executive in a \n\"participative management\" company told me recently, \"The implicit \nassumption around here is that the solution to all problems is sharing \nour views.\"  \nWhile participative openness leads to people speaking out, \"re-\nflective openness\" leads to people looking inward. Reflective openness \nstarts with the willingne ss to challenge our own thinking, to recognize \nthat any certainty we ever have is, at best, a hypothesis about the \nworld. No matter how compelling it may be, no matter how fond we \nare of \"our idea,\" it is always subject to test and improvement. \nReflective openness lives in the attitude, \"I may be", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2688, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b9197bb-5bd9-4d36-a138-bf9edec1e347": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b9197bb-5bd9-4d36-a138-bf9edec1e347", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "253", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

Once we \nfeel as if we have \"the answer,\" a ll motivation to question our thinking \ndisappears. But the discipline of systems thinking shows that there \nsimply is \"no right answer\" when dealing with complexity. For this \nreason, openness and systems thinking are closely linked.  \nA simple exercise we have used in our leadership workshops for \nmany years gets at the central point.4 We cover a large wall with blank \npaper, and then ask the group to work together to map out all the \nfeedback relationships in a particular problem with which they are \nwrestling. \"For instance,\" we might say, \"let's create a systems \ndiagram to figure out how to balance our work and family responsi-\nbilities.\" We usually start by identi fying key variables and writing them \non different parts of the large paper: time pressures; expectations of \noneself; responsibilities; personal interests; career goals; distance \nbetween work and home; and so on. Then we begin suggesting \nfeedback links: expectations influence career goals; distance between \nwork and home influences time available for family; personal income \ninfluences independence, as well as  budget. Within a half hour, we've \ncovered the wall with circles and arrows. Everyone in the room feels \noverwhelmed, and yet we know that we've just begun to show the \nhundreds of interrelationships that  exist in the real system. People \ngradually come to realize that no one could possibly come to figure \nout all these interactions.  \nThis realization has a remarkable impact on people. Some try to \nrationalize it away: \"Well, this is so obvious it's meaningless,\" they say. \n\"What's the point?\" Others insist that, given enough time, they could \neventually figure it out.

In the \nlate 1970s, Donella Meadows led a three-hour workshop on Third \nWorld malnutrition with respected international experts, trying to \nbuild a comprehensive model, based on all their knowledge, of the \ncauses of global hunger. Before lo ng, the chart included everything \nfrom economic factors to politics to cultural values to international \ntrade. In the audience, an experienced lobbyist on food and peace \nissues began moaning and shaking her head. Finally, Donella \nstopped the session to ask if she was ill. \"My God,\" said the lobbyist. \n\"All my life, I assumed that some body, somewhere, knew the answer \nto this problem. I thought politicians knew what had to be done, but \nrefused to do it out of politics and greed. But now I realize that \nnobody knows the answer. Not us, not them, not anybody.\" \nThe \"Wall\" reveals some fascinating insights into the roots of \nauthoritarianism in our own thinking . Most people have grown up in an \nauthoritarian environment. As children, their parents had \"the \nanswers.\" As students, their teachers had the answers. Naturally, \nwhen they enter organizations, they assume that \"the boss\" must \nhave the answers. They are convinced deep down that people above \nthem know what is going on, or at least they ought to know if they are \ncompetent. This mentality weaken s them as individuals, and the \norganization as a whole. At some level it absolves them of responsi-\nbility in the organization's learning. It also predisposes them to cyn-\nicism when events eventually reveal that the people at the top did not \nhave all the answers. \nConversely, when people in an organization come collectively to \nrecognize that nobody has the answers, it liberates the organization in \na remarkable way. I heard the reason articulated soon after we \nincorporated the \"Wall\" exercise into the workshop. One participant \nwas a vice president of a Boston-based high-tech company. He had \nstudied Zen Buddhism for ten years and was a very successful and \ncreative engineer. After the exercise he remarked, \"Many people will \nsay that once you recognize that you can never figure life out, you \nhave denied rationality. But th at's not true. You have simply \nrecontextualized rationality. To search for understanding, knowing that \nthere is no ultimate answer, becomes a creative process\u2014 one which \ninvolves rationality but also something more.\" \nThis, of course, is the state of being open. You realize, as the \n\"Wall\" experience shows, that any \"answer\" you have is at best an \napproximation\u2014always su bject to improvement, never final.

The fear that \"I don't know, but perhaps \nhe or she does,\" or, \"I don't know but I should,\" dissolves. We \ncome to peace with knowing that we do not know, or as Einstein \nsaid, that \"the most beautiful thing we can experience is the myste-\nrious. It is the source of all true art and science.\"5 \nUnfortunately, the way knowledge is organized and structured in \ncontemporary society destroys this sense of mystery. The \"com-\npartmentalization of knowledge\" creates a false sense of confidence. \nFor example, the traditional disciplin es that influence management \u2014\nsuch disciplines as economics, accounting, marketing, and psy-\nchology\u2014divide the world into neat subdivisions within which one can \noften say, \"This is the problem and here is its solution.\" But the \nboundaries that make the subdivisio ns are fundamentally arbitrary \u2014\nas any manager finds out who attempts to treat an important problem \nas if it is purely \"an economic pr oblem,\" or \"an accounting problem,\" \nor \"a personnel problem.\" Life comes to us whole. It is only the \nanalytic lens we impose that makes it seem as if problems can be \nisolated and solved. When we forget that it is \"only a lens,\" we lose \nthe spirit of openness.  \nThis does not mean that all problems are unsolvable. Some prob-\nlems do have \"correct solutions,\" such as finding the best sitings for oil \nrefineries once production and final distribution points, volume of \ndemand, and costs of transport have been identified; or determining \nthe optimal mix of debt and equity financing once a new investment \nproject has been chosen and interest and dividend rates are estab-\nlished. These are problems where nearly all the dynamic complexity can \nbe ignored with minimal side effects. Unfortunately, these are often \nnot the most important problems that managers confront.  \nThe British economist E. F. Schumacher, best known for writing \nSmall is Beautiful, argued (in his book A Guide for the Perplexed) that \nthere are two fundamentally different types of problems: \"convergent \nproblems\" and \"divergent problems.\"6 Convergent problems have a \nsolution: \"the more intelligently you study them, the more the \nanswers converge.\" Divergent problems have no \"correct\" solution. \nThe more they are studied by people with knowledge and intelligence \nthe more they \"come up with answers which contradict one another.\" \nThe difficulty lies not with the experts, but in the nature of the \nproblem itself.

Rather, they are problems for \nwhich there is no single, best soluti on. As Schumacher says, \"divergent \nproblems offend the logical mind, wh ich wishes to remove tension by \ncoming down on one side or the other.'' \n\"How to best develop our people?\" \"What new products to invest \nin?\" \"How can we best satisfy our customers?\"\u2014these are divergent \nproblems. Only genuine openness allo ws people to deal productively \nwith them. \nTHE SPIRIT OF OPENNESS \nWhile reflective openness benefits significantly from reflection and \ninquiry skills, and from systems thinking knowledge and skills, openness \nis more than a set of skills. As O'Brien says, \"We should be careful \nnot to prescribe a clinical treatment of a spiritual subject. Openness \ngoes beyond a personal quality. It's a relationship you have with \nothers. It is a change in spirit, as well as a set of skills and practices.\" \nIt is most accurate to think of openness as a characteristic of \nrelationships, not of individuals. At  some level, it makes no sense to \nsay, \"I am an open person.\" The same person will experience genuine \nopenness with some people and not with others. In this sense, like \nDavid Bohm's concept of dialogue, openness emerges when two or more \nindividuals become willing to suspend their certainty in each other's \npresence. They become willing to sh are their thinking and susceptible \nto having their thinking influenced  by one another. And, as Bohm \npoints out, in a state of openness, they gain access to depths of \nunderstanding npt accessible otherwise. \nIf openness is a quality of relations hips, then building relationships \ncharacterized by openness may be one of the most high-leverage \nactions to build organizations char acterized by openness.

When small groups of people (as few as two or three) become \ndeeply committed and open they create a microcosm of a learning \norganization. This microcosm not only teaches them  the skills they \nneed but becomes a model for others.  \nThe impulse toward openness, as O'Brien says, \"is the spirit of \nlove.\" Love is, of course, a diffic ult word to use in the context of \nbusiness and management. But O'Brien does not mean romantic \nlove. In fact, the type of love that underlies openness, what the \nGreeks called agape, has little to do with emotions.7 It has everything to \ndo with intentions\u2014commitment to serve one another, and \nwillingness to be vulnerable in the context of that service. The best \ndefinition of the love that underlies openness is the full and uncon-\nditional commitment to another's \"completion,\" to another being all \nthat she or he can and wants to be.  \n\"I can practice all the analytical steps in the world toward open-\nness,\" O'Brien says, \"and it is not enough. If you have the funda-\nmental spiritual disposition, without the skill you'll be ineffective. But, \non the other hand, if you develo p the skill without the spiritual \ndisposition, that won't work fully either.\"  \nThis is a tough, challenging notion of love (sometimes characterized \nby the phrase \"ruthless compassion\") which brooks no compromise in \nboth sharing one's feelings and views and being open to having those \nviews change.  \nFREEDOM  \nW h e n  m o s t  p e o p l e  s a y ,  \" I  a m  f r ee to do what I want,\" what they \nmean is: \"I have freedom of action .

For example, in the beer game de-\nscribed in Chapter 3, people can run their local operation any way \nthey want. Yet, ironically, the re sults they produce, in almost all \ncases, are contrary to what they intend. Because of this, they often \nfeel helpless, trapped within a set of forces they cannot control, \ndespite being free to make their own decisions. Moreover, they have \nthe power to produce much more successful results\u2014if they'd \nchange their ways of thinking an d acting.

Or, as Ray Stata, CEO of Analog Devices, Inc., \nsays, \"In the traditional hierarchical organization, the top thinks and \nthe local acts. In a learning organization, you have to merge thinking \nand acting in every individual.\"  \nLocalness is especially vital in times of rapid change. Local actors \noften have more current information on customer preferences, com-\npetitor actions, and market trends; they are in a better position to \nmanage the continuous adaptation that change demands.  \nIn the Royal Dutch/She ll study on corporate longevity (cited at the \nbeginning of Chapter 2), the long-term survivors, according to Shell \nPlanning Coordinator Arie de Geus, were the ones with \"the ability to \ncontinually run 'experiments in the margin,' to continually explore new \nbusiness possibilities.\" The experiments usually originated locally. \nLocalness is a cornerstone in designing learning organizations.1 \nBut localness also means unique new challenges, unmet and un-\nsolved in traditional hierarchical organizations. Two in particular \nstand out in organizations I have seen that struggle with localness. The \nfirst concerns the conflicts which many managers, especially senior \nmanagers, experience in giving up \"being in control,\" giving over \ndecision-making authority to local managers. The second concerns \nhow to make local control work.  \nThe ambivalence of many senior managers to giving over greater \nauthority and control of decision making is, in part, rooted in fear of \nloss. Will senior or corporate management become unneeded or \nsomehow less important\u2014mere window dressing in the locally con-\ntrolled organization? This fear is unfortunate because it keeps many \nsenior managers from discovering their new role in a locally controlled \norganization: responsibility for continually enhancing the organization's \ncapacity for learning. One of the big problems plaguing organizations \nthat are becoming more localized is that corporate management, \nparalyzed by the fear of what they might lose, are neglecting this very \nimportant new role.  \nThe ambivalence of many managers to localness is also rooted in \nlegitimate questions: how can locally controlled organizations \nachieve coordination, synergy between business units, and collabo-\nrative efforts toward common corporate-wide objectives? In other \nwords, how can the organization achieve \"control\" if local managers \nare not being controlled? How can the locally controlled organization \nbe something other than simply a \"holding company,\" where \ncorporate headquarters imposes financial standards and otherwise \nleaves local operations completely alone?", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2677, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "70684de7-e108-4644-baf1-fa9848f88a66": {"__data__": {"id_": "70684de7-e108-4644-baf1-fa9848f88a66", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "264", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

The \ntrend is led by many of the most respected corporations today, such as \nRoyal Dutch/Shell, Johnson & Johnson, 3M, and Citicorp. It is \nabundantly clear that rigid authoritarian hierarchies thwart learning, \nfailing both to harness the spirit, enthusiasm, and knowledge of people \nthroughout the organization and to be responsive to shifting business \nconditions. Yet, the alternatives to  authoritarian hierarchies are less \nthan clear.2 \nFailure to resolve the dilemmas and puzzles inherent in localness \nhas caused some of the most daring prototype learning organizations to \nfail. Some have failed because, despite strong feelings for values such \nas freedom and individual responsi bility, senior managers could not \nbring themselves to give up the control that traditionally comes with \ntheir office. Others have failed because they did give up the control, \nand then found that enthusiastic committed local decision makers did \nnot necessarily make good decision ma kers. Still others made attempts \nat involving people more in decision making, but failed to go far \nenough in letting people develop their own visions, design their own \nstrategies and structures, and assume responsibility for their own \nlearning.  \nThe disciplines of the learning organization can help in making \nlocalness work. For example, learning how to work with managers' \nmental models can help in coordinating locally controlled companies. \nIt is no coincidence that the organizations leading in the development \nof the discipline of mental models for example, such as Royal \nDutch/Shell and Hanover Insurance, have a high degree of local \ncontrol. The combination of mental models and the other disciplines \npaints a new picture of how a locally controlled organization can \nfunction\u2014\"control through learning.\"  \nWhile traditional organizations re quire management systems that \ncontrol people's behavior, learning organizations invest in improving \nthe quality of thinking, the capacity for reflectio n and team learning, and \nthe ability to develop shared visi ons and shared understandings of \ncomplex business issues.

Beyond money, beyond fame, what drives most \nexecutives of traditional organizations is power, the desire to be in \ncontrol. Most would rather give  up anything than control.\" \nYet, the perception that someone \"up there\" is in control is based \non an illusion\u2014the illusion that anyone could master the dynamic \nand detailed complexity of an organization from the top. \nA simple illustration, which I learned many years ago from managers \nat Kollmorgen, demonstrates the point. Imagine that you have two \nroller skates, attached to one anot her by a spring. You use the first \nroller skate to control the motion of the second. Its a bit tricky, but \ndoable. Now, add a third roller skat e, attached with another spring\u2014\nand, moreover, give that new spring  a different \"spring constant\" (i.e., \nmake it either easier or more diffic ult to extend than the first spring). \nNow, try to control the third roller  skate by moving only the ft st. \nIt's much trickier. Keep adding roller skates, each attached by springs \nwith different spring constants. It doesn't take long to give up any \nhope of controlling the roller skate at the far end of the line. \nOrganizations are infinitely more comple x than this simple line of roller \nskates and springs. You can begin to see why one person dictating \norders from \"one end'of the line\" cannot possibly control what \nhappens in a complex organization. \nThe illusion of being in control can appear quite real. In hierarchical \norganizations, leaders give orders an d others follow. But giving orders \nis not the same as being in control.  Power may be concentrated at the \ntop but having the power of unilat eral decision making is not the \nsame as being able to  achieve one's objectives. Authority figures may \nbe treated deferentially, lavished with the highest salaries and other \nprivileges of rank, but that does not  mean that they actually exercise \ncontrol commensurate with their apparent importance. \nBecause of the lingering belief that you can control decisions from", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2461, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "820b65eb-1007-4249-b403-9e11f2e4a893": {"__data__": {"id_": "820b65eb-1007-4249-b403-9e11f2e4a893", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "266", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

When business goes well, decisions are made more and more \nlocally. When business begins to founder, the first instincts are to \nreturn control to central management. This \"on again/off again\" \npattern of decision making testifies to the deep lack of confidence \nwhich senior managers have in loca l decision makers. Moreover, this \ncentralizing/localizing cycle is a \"shifting the burden\" structure. At any \nhint of a crisis, the company shifts the burden of decision making back \nto the central staffs. Local decision-making skills atrophy and the \ninfrastructure never develops whic h would help people experiment, \ncoordinate, and learn on the local level.  \nUnderstanding that it is usually impossible to control a complex \norganization from the top can help senior managers begin to give up \nthe need to feel \"in control.\" But, for many, it is not enough. The \nemotional hold of being in control will relax only if localness is what they \ntruly want. Unless they believe that the quality of learning, the ability to \nadapt, the excitement and enthusiasm, and the human growth \nfostered by localness are worth the risk, they are unlikely ever to \nchoose to build a locally controlled organization.

Enough people in local operations \nmust truly want the responsibility and freedom of greater local \nautonomy. Otherwise, no lasting movement will occur.  \nBy contrast, today many organi zations are cutting management \nlevels and becoming more locally controlled because of expediency, \ndriven by pressures to cut costs. Such moves to localness are not \nlikely to lead to lasting, signific ant redistribution of decision-making \nauthority; as soon as a recession comes, corporate managers will \n\"pull in the reins\" and once again increase management controls in \nthe name of \"weathering the storm.\"  \nIllustrative of the type of comm itment required for localness to \nwork is the following statement from Hanover's Bill O'Brien:  \nWe are living in a time when people believe they can have less and \nl e s s  i n f l u e n c e  o n  e v e n t s  ...

If the organization's vision is \nimposed on local units, it will, at best, result in compliance not \ncommitment. If there is an ongoing \"visioning\" process, local visions \nand organizational visions will contin ually interact with and enrich one \nanother.

Personal mastery is \nvital because localness places enormous demands on an organiza-\ntion's leadership resources. Local business managers must be leaders \nas well as competent managers.  \nLastly, in the absence of systems th inking, local decision making can \nbecome myopic and short-term. This happens because local decision \nmakers fail to see the interdependencies by which their actions affect \nothers outside their local sphere.  \nThere is a particular systems archet ype, first identifi ed by ecolo-gist \nGarrett Hardin and call ed \"The Tragedy of the Commons,\" which is \nespecially relevant for making localness work.10 It describes situations \nwhere what's right for each part is wrong for the whole. The \narchetype is useful for dealing direct ly with problems where apparently \nlogical local decision making can be come completely illogical for the \nlarger system.  \nFor example, the Sahel region in sub-Saharan Africa was once a \nfertile pastureland. In the middle of this century, it supported over a \nhundred thousand herdsmen and over a half million head of grazing \ncattle (called \"zebu\"). Today, it is barren desert, yielding a small \nfraction of the vegetation it produced before. The people left there \nscratch out a meager existence unde r continual threat of drought and \nstarvation.  \nThe tragedy of the Sahel was rooted in steady growth of population \nand herd sizes from the 1920s to the 1970s. The growth accelerated \nfrom 1955 to 1965 due to unusually heavy rainfalls and assistance \nfrom international aid organizations who financed numerous deep \nwells. Each herdsman on the Sahel had incentives to expand his herd \nof zebu, both for economic gain and social status. As long as the \ncommon grazing lands were large enou gh to support these new, larger \nherds, there were no problems. But in the early 1960s, overgrazing \nbegan to occur. Eventually rangeland vegetation grew sparser. The \nsparser the vegetation, the more overgrazing, until it got to the point \nwhere the cattle consumed more foliage than the ranges could \ngenerate. The desertification reinforc ed itself as decreases in plant \ncover allowed wind and rain to erode the soil. Less vegetation was \nproduced, which got overgrazed more severely to support the herds, \nleading to further desertification. The vicious spiral continued until \ndisaster struck in the form of a series of droughts in the 1960s and \n1970s. By the early 1970s, 50 to 80 percent of the livestock was dead \nand much of the population of the Sahel was destitute.\"", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2605, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5126f71f-eb51-48fd-89a5-e9cf40edad38": {"__data__": {"id_": "5126f71f-eb51-48fd-89a5-e9cf40edad38", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "270", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

But, the sum total of all the \nindividuals acting in their self-interest (the diagram shows two rein-\nforcing loops for two individuals\u2014in reality there may be hundreds or \nthousands of individual local decision makers) add up to a \"total \nactivity\" with a life of its own.

It's not enough \nfor one individual to see the proble m; the problem cannot be solved \nuntil most decision makers act together for the good of the whole.  \nDon't think that the Tragedy of the Commons structure is limited \nto ecological disasters. Tragedies of the Commons occur frequently in \nbusinesses where \"localness\" is valued. It happens, for example, when \nseveral locally autonomous divisions share a common support group\u2014\na research team, a sales force, or a secretarial pool. Each division \nhead worries that his section won't receive adequate attention from \nthe shared department. Thus, one division head advises his staff to \nmake more of their requests high priority. Other divisions see this \ndivision pushing for more support and decide to try the same strategy. \nBefore long, most of the requests coming in are \"high priority\" and \nthe staff starts to discount them. Or, worse yet, the support staff tries \nto accomplish everything asked of  them, so they a ccept all the extra \nrequests, become overburdened with juggling priorities, and their work \nquality rapidly deteriorates until they're no longer useful to anyone.  \nCorporations have many depletable \"commons\" to share: financial \ncapital, productive capital, technology, community reputation, good \nwill of customers, good will and support of suppliers, and morale and \ncompetence of employees to^name just a few. When a company \ndecentralizes, local divisions conipete with each other for those limited \nresources.  \nTragedy of the Commons structures are most insidious when the \ncoupling from individual action to collective consequence is weak in the \nshort run, yet strong in the long run. When this happens, the \n\"commons\" usually go unrecognized. Local managers see their actions \nas independent, they don't realize ho w they may be jeopardizing their \nand others' future. They fail to see how their individual \"activity\" will \neventually reduce everyone's \"gain per activity.\"  \nThe \"commons\" can be as simple, and subtle, as the limited time", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2681, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e63cc31f-8a63-4194-a7ac-4b219b50d143": {"__data__": {"id_": "e63cc31f-8a63-4194-a7ac-4b219b50d143", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "272", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

These \naggressive division presidents are accountable for their own profits, \nthey are measured by their quarterly and yearly results, and they expect \nto stay in that position for two to  four years.

This second approach puts the onus on local \nmanagers to practice self-restraint. For example, if customers' adverse \nreactions to multiple contacts from competing local units were \nimmediately made known to all local units, pressure to limit or \ncoordinate such contacts would be  felt.

As noted \nabove, one element of the role involves stewardship for the \norganization, \"guiding ideas,\" its core values and mission, and its \ncontinually evolving visions. But there are additional elements that are \nnot yet recognized.  \nAs Ed Simon puts it, \"The first important discovery [in building \nlearning organizations] is that there is different work to be done by \nexecutives.

What does she or he research? \nUnderstanding the organization as a system and understanding the \ninternal and external forces driving change. What does she or he \ndesign? The learning processes whereby managers throughout the \norganization come to understand these trends and forces.  \nTo illustrate, one of the most important new tools for accelerating \nlearning and for fostering shared ment al models of the larger system \namong local decision makers is micr oworlds. These are microcosms of \nreal business settings where teams of managers together learn by \nconducting experiments that are difficult or impossible to conduct in \nreal business. (Chapter 17 describes microworlds in depth.) Devel-\noping a microworld involves resear ch to understand the systemic \nstructures underlying particular business issues, then developing a \nlearning process for managers who work and live with these issues day \nby day. The research and design of microworlds will, I believe, come to \nbe a primary task of central management in learning organizations of \nthe future.  \nIn many ways the role of \"manager as researcher\" is already \nstarting to be practiced. For ex ample, in firms that are seriously \npracticing total quality, local managers join with workers in the con-\ntinual analysis and improvement of work processes.  \nThis does not mean that central or corporate managers no longer \nparticipate in decision making.

But, designing the organization's \nlearning processes is a unique role which cannot be delegated. It \ncannot be done by local managers  because local managers are too \ninvolved running their businesses and because local managers gen-\nerally have less breadth of perspe ctive to see the major, long-term \nissues and forces that will shape how the business evolves. The job of \nmanagers as designers is developed further in Chapter 18 (\"The \nLeader's New Work\"). If it is not seen as the responsibility of cor-\nporate management, including the most senior managers, it will not be \ndone, or it will not be done well. The fact that few of those presently \nin such positions recognize this role is one of the main reasons that \nlearning organizations are still rare. \nFORGIVENESS \nTo be effective, localness must encourage risk taking among local \nmanagers. But to encourage risk taking  is to practice forgiveness. Real \nforgiveness includes \"forgive\" and \"forget.\" Sometimes, organizations \nwill \"forgive\" in the sense of not firing someone if he makes a mistake, \nbut the screw up will always be hanging over the offender's head. Real \nforgiveness includes \"reconciliation,\" mending the relationships that \nmay have been hurt by the mistake. \nJames Burke illustrates how he learned about forgiveness at Johnson \n& Johnson, during his first mont hs as head of a new-products \ndivision. One day he was summoned to the office of Chairman General \nRobert Wood Johnson. One of Burke's first product ideas, a children's \nchest rub, had failed dismally. Wh en Burke walked in Johnson asked, \n\"Are you the one who just cost us all that money?\" Burke nodded. \nThe general said/ \"Well, I just want to congratulate you. If you are \nmaking mistakes, that means you are making decisions and taking risks. \nAnd we won't grow unless you take risks.\"l2 \nThen there is the legend of Captain Kohei Asoh, who, in 1968, \nlanded his Japan Air Lines DC-8 jetliner two and a half miles short of \nthe runway, out in the waters of San Francisco Bay. The craft made a \nperfect three-point touchdown. Fortun ately, the bay is only about ten \nfeet deep at that point. The crew remained composed. The ninety-six \npassengers exited in an orderly fashion into the escape rafts which the \ncrew prepared for them. There was not even much damage to the \ncraft. \nSoon afterward, the National Transportation Safety Board held an \ninquiry. Captain Asoh was summoned as the first witness. The chief \ninvestigator asked for his excuses, presumably expecting the usual \nchastened rationalizations or finger pointing. \"Captain Asoh, in your \nown words, can you tell us how you managed to land that DC-8 \nstretch jet two and a half miles out in San Francisco Bay in perfect \ncompass line with the runway?\" Asoh's response, though never re-\ncorded in the official NTSB minutes, has gone down in airline folklore: \n\"As you Americans say, Asoh fuck up.\" The captain took full \nresponsibility for the error.

Schon calls this \"reflection-in-action\" and talks about it as a \ncharacteristic of professionals who are successful learners. \"Phrases \nlike 'thinking on your feet,' 'keeping your wits about you,' and \n'learning by doing,' \" he wrote, \"suggest not only that we can think \nabout doing but that we can th ink about doing something while doing \nit.\" \nBut many American managers are too busy running to \"think on \ntheir feet.\" For most of us our internal pictures about the nature of \nour work say that activity is good, that a manager's job is to keep \nthings moving.

When an individual is managing mental \nmodels, for example, it takes cons iderable time to surface assump-\ntions, examine their consistency and accuracy, and see how different \nmodels can be knit together into more systemic perspectives on im-\nportant problems.  \nThe management of time and attention is an area where top man-\nagement has a significant influence, not by edict but by example. For \ninstance, O'Brien simply doesn't schedule short meetings. \"If it isn't a \nsubject that is worthy of an hour, it shouldn't be on my calendar.\" In a \nwell-designed organization, the only issues that should reach a senior \nmanager's atteufion^should be co mplex, dilemma-like \"divergent\" \nissues. These are the issues that r equire the thought and experience of \nthe most senior people, in addition to the input of less experienced \npeople. If top managers are handling twenty problems in a workday, \neither they are spending too much time on \"convergent\" problems that \nshould be dealt with more locally in the organization, or they are \ngiving insufficient time to complex problems. Either way, it is a sign \nthat management work is being handled poorly. \"It's a big year for \nme,\" O'Brien adds, \"if I make twelve decisions. I may pick someone \nto report directly to me. I may set a direction. But my job is not \nconsumed with making many decisions. It is consumed with \nidentifying important issues the organization must address in the \nfuture, helping others sort through decisions they must make, and the \noverarching tasks of organizational design\" (see Chapter 18 on the \ndesign functions of leadership).  \nThe principle is simple to say and understand, but it's not the way \nmost organizations operate. Instead, people at the top continually \nmake decisions on issues such as how to run a promotion\u2014as op-\nposed to why they need to run prom otions at all. Or they discuss \nhow to make a sale to a particular customer\u2014instead of inquiring \nabout how their products serve the customers' expressed and latent \nneeds in general.  \nOn the other hand, as the basic learning disciplines start to become \nassimilated into an organization, a different view of managerial work \nwill develop. Action will still be critical, but incisive action will not be \nconfused with incessant activity.

It seems that the author, like most of the rest of us, simply \naccepts the fact that work inevitably conflicts with family life, and that \nthe organization has no part to play  in improving imbalances between \nwork and family.  \nIn recent years, I have noticed a considerable increase in concern \nover the work-family issue among participants in our Leadership and \nMastery programs. Today, \"finding balance between my work and my \nfamily\" is cited as a number-one pr iority by more at tendees than any \nother single issue.  \nTraditional organizations undeniably foster conflict between work \nand family. Sometimes, this is done consciously\u2014through the simple \nthreat that, \"If you want to get ahead here, you must be willing to \nmake sacrifices.\" More often, it is done inadvertently, by simply \ncreating a set of demands and pressu res on the individual that inevi-\ntably conflict with family and personal time. These demands include \ntravel, dinner meetings, the increasingly common breakfast meetings, \nweekend retreats, and just plain old long hours at the shop. The \npressures arise primarily from th e narrow focus on organizational \ngoals and objectives to the exclusion of personal goals and objectives. \nIn other words, if all that matters is  the organization's goals, there is \nsimply \"no space\" for weighing the cost of those goals for an \nindividual or the individual's family.  \nThe disciplines of the learning organization will, I believe, end the \ntaboo that has surrounded the topic of balancing work and family, \nand has kept it off the corporate agenda. The learning organization \ncannot support personal mastery without supporting personal mas-\ntery in all aspects of life. It ca nnot foster shared vision without \ncalling forth personal visions, and personal visions are always mul-\ntifaceted\u2014they always include deeply felt desires for our personal, \nprofessional, organizational, and family lives. Lastly, the artificial \nboundary between work and family is anathema to systems thinking. \nThere is a natural connection between a person's work life and all \nother aspects of life. We live only one life, but for a long time our \norganizations have operated as if this simple fact could be ignored, as \nif we had two separate lives.  \nTHE STRUCTURE OF WORK/FAMILY IMBALANCE  \nThere is a systems archetype underlying the work-family imbalance. \nThis archetype is called \"Success to the Successful\" because it consists \nof two reinforcing growth processes, each of which tend to fuel", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2564, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f3b1744-a293-41f4-bfbe-2e2ffaaae13b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f3b1744-a293-41f4-bfbe-2e2ffaaae13b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "283", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

What could be a better description of effective \nparenting? The fact that many parents don't succeed especially well \nsimply shows that we haven't created the learning environment for \nparenting, just as we've not created the learning environment for \ndeveloping leaders.\"  \nO'Brien's reflections open up what I suspect will become an in-\ncreasingly important topic in comi ng years: looking for the synergy \nbetween productive family life and productive work life. The old \nworld of sharp boundaries between work and family is falling away. A \nnew world of blurred boundaries is he re, and it is a world that only a \nfew organizations are facing up to.  \nIn that old world, the man worked and the woman stayed at home \nto raise the children. Today, in families with children where at least one \nmember holds a management position, only 51.5 percent have a stay-\nat-home spouse\u2014in 28 percent either bo th spouses are at work or it is \na single-parent family.3 And the percentage of families with no spouse \nat home is continuing to rise.4 One of the implications of this dramatic \nchange is that family issues spill over much more into the managers' \nlives simply because there is no one else at home to whom the \nproblem can be delegated. It also means that there are, by and large, \nmore family issues.  \nIn the old world, people's personal interests were their own con-\ncern. The corporation wanted only \"an honest day's work for an \nhonest day's pay.\" In the learning organization, the boundaries be-\ntween what is personal and what is organizational are intentionally \nblurred. Learning organizations enter into a new compact, or \"cov-\nenant\" as Max de Pree puts it, with their members. The essence of \nthis compact is the organization's commitment to support the full \ndevelopment of each employee, and the person's reciprocal commit-\nment to the organization.5 Intentional or inadvertent pressures that \nmake success at work and success at home an \"either/or\" proposition \nviolate this compact.  \nI believe these changes will lead more organizations to recognize \nwhat is long overdue\u2014that organizations must undo the divisive \npressures and demands that make balancing work and family so \nburdensome today.

It's a \nvirtuous circle: not only is being a good parent a training ground for \nbeing a learningful manager, but being a learningful manager is also \ngood preparation for parenting. The conflict between work and home \ndiminishes dramatically when the organization fosters values in \nalignment with people's own core, values that have equal meaning at \nwork and at home.

While the computer-based microworlds described \nbelow are new, the principle of learning through microworlds is ac-\ntually familiar to us all.  \nWhen they play with dolls, childr en rehearse ways of interacting \nwith people. When they play with blocks, they teach themselves basic \nprinciples of spatial geometry and mechanics. Later in life they will \nlearn the general properties of the pendulum through swinging on a \nswing and all about levers through the playground teeter-totter. The \ndoll, the blocks, the swing, and teeter-totter are what educational \ntheorists call \"transitional objects\"; the playroom or the playground is a \nmicroworld, a microcosm of reality where it is safe to play. Through \nexperimentation with transitional objects in micro-worlds, children \ndiscover principles and develop skills that are relevant in reality beyond \nplay.1 \nThey also achieve a rate of learning  that is truly astounding. By the \nage of three or four, children have learned basic principles of geometry \nand mechanics; they have mastered natural language, a feat which \nartificial intelligence researchers admi t is still on the distant horizon for \nmachines; and they have learned all about the \"social systems\" of \nhome life such as \"If I don't clean my room, my mother will.\" All \nwithout ever being \"taught.\"  \nLearning through transitional objects and microworlds is not limited \nto children. The aeronautical engine er's model in a wind tunnel is a \ntransitional object in a microworld, as is the naval designer's model \nship in a \"wave tank.\" Managers too have transitional objects and \nmicroworlds. When a work team goes white-water rafting or engages \nin some other outdoor team-building exercise, they are creating a \nmicroworld to reflect on and impr ove the way they work together. \nWhen personnel staff create a role-p laying exercise to be used in \nsupervisory training they are crea ting a microworld. Many team \nretreats serve as microworlds, as illustrated by the \"dialogue\" practice \nsessions discussed in the Team Learning chapter. Consultants often \nserve as a transitional object of sorts\u2014a safe sounding board for \nexploring new and different business ideas without the risks of \ndirectly putting those ideas into practice.  \nBut existing microworlds for managers are limited.

Perhaps most importantly, few existing microworlds \ndevelop individual or team capacities to deal productively with com-\nplexity. Few capture the dynamic complexity that confronts the \nmanagement team when it seeks to craft new strategies, design new \nstructures and operating policies, or plan significant organizational \nchange.  \nNow a new type of microworld is emerging. Personal computers are \nmaking it possible to integrate learning about complex team in-\nteractions with learning about co mplex business interactions. These \nnew microworlds allow groups to reflect on, expose, test, and improve \nthe mental models upon which they rely in facing difficult problems. \nThey are settings for both crafting visions and experimenting with a \nbroad range of strategies and policies for achieving those visions. \nGradually, they are becoming a ne w type of \"practice field\" for \nmanagement teams, places where teams will learn how to learn \ntogether while engaging their mo st important business issues.  \nMicroworlds will, I believe, prove to be a critical technology for \nimplementing the disciplines of the learning organization. And they \nwill accomplish this by helping us rediscover the power of learning \nthrough play.

Micro-worlds \nare places for \"relevant play.\" There the issues and dynamics of \ncomplex business situations can be explored through trying out new \nstrategies and policies and seeing what might happen. Costs of failed \nexperiments disappear. Organi zational sanctions against \nexperimentation, either implicit or explicit, are nonexistent. Reflecting \non our own and our team's learning skills can be enlightening and \n\"lightening\" (as in \"lightening up \") because this reflection can be \nseparated from the risks and pre ssures of real decision making.  \nToday, microworlds for managers are exploring diverse issues \nfrom managing growth to product development and improving quality \nin both service and manufacturing businesses.

They illustrate the range of \nstrategic and operational issues that microworlds can illuminate:  \n1. Future Learning: in which a management team discovers internal \ncontradictions in a strategy that is only just being put into place; \n2. Seeing Hidden Strategic Opportunities: in which a team experi \nments with its members' mental models, and discovers that the \nassumptions team members hold ca n shape their customers' pref \nerences; \n3.

Frequently, these assumptions have internal \ncontradictions. When they do, the strategy also has internal con-\ntradictions, which will prove to make it difficult or impossible to \nimplement. One benefit of microwor lds is bringing these assumptions \ninto the open and discovering these inconsistencies.  \nOne such case occurred at a highly successful manufacturer of \nmicrocomputers (here called th e \"Index Computer Company\").2 The \ntop management team had introduced a microworld as a part of a two-\nday planning retreat. They had taken on a strategic goal four months \nearlier: to reach $2 billion in sale s in four years. They were all \ncommitted to the goal, from Index's President Tom Jamison on down. \nAnd everyone seemed happy with the progress so far.  \nThat's why the vice president of Sales, James Sawyer, felt so \nuneasy. It was difficult enough to  keep and train his present sales \nforce\u2014how did they expect him to  double it?

He didn't want his fellow executives to \nthink he lacked their commitment to that magic $2 billion figure. He \ndidn't want to get the reputation of a \"nay sayer.\" And he certainly \ndidn't want to let on that he thought he might not rise to the occa-\nsion, especially since he had a re putation as a \"fixer\" who could \nsolve any problem. But every time he thought about the future, an \ninvoluntary shudder of pain ran through his stomach.  \nSoon the executives split into three-person microworld teams to\n \n\\ \nplay out the consequences of the sales plan. Their first task was to \nconstruct an explicit model on the computer of the assumptions be-\nhind the plan.3 The plan called for a 20 pe rcent annual sales growth, a \ncontinuation of the growth rate of the past ten years. And it also \ncalled for 20 percent more salespeople each year. As they looked at \nsimulated sales figures for the next four years, it didn't take them \nlong to recognize that the official plan implicitly assumed that the \nproductivity of salespeople would hold steady as the sales force \nexpanded. Hire 20 percent more salespeople, you make 20 percent \nmore sales.  \nMaking the assumption explicit prompt ed Sawyer to say, \"Well, wait \na minute. Not all salespeople are equal. There is so much they have to \nlearn\u2014about office automation, software, training, accounting, \nengineering, consulting, and manufacturing\u2014before they can place a \nsingle system. Much of our histor ic growth,\" he continued, \"came \nfrom hiring experienced salespeople whom we lured away from our \ncompetitors. We could do that as long as we were small. But now the \nnumbers of new hires we need to sustain our 20 percent growth are \ngetting much larger. We will not be able to get this many people by \nhiring away from our competitor s. We'll be hiring many more \ninexperienced salespeople in the future.\"  \nSawyer's comment sparked a lively debate about the differences in \nproductivity between experienced and inexperienced salespeople.

Al-\nthough they hired enough total salespeople to meet their plan, the \nmix of inexperienced and veteran salespeople shifted progressively \ntoward the inexperienced, pulling down average productivity. (The \neffects of rapid growth on the mix of experienced personnel, you may \nrecall, was also an important dynamic at People Express Airlines in \nChapter 8.)  \nThe different work teams tried furiously to find a set of assump-\ntions they could believe w^hicfr would pr oduce $2 billion in sales in four \nyears. No one could do it. To see just how extreme the problems might \nbecome, one group asked the question, \"How many salespeople would \nw e  h a v e  t o  h i r e  i f  w e  s i m p l y  k e p t  hiring until our sales targets were \nmet?\" They found that, \"We'd end up almost doubling the sales force in \nthe fourth year alone, if we doggedly kept adding bodies until our sales \ntarget was reached.\" All knew that this magnitude of personnel growth \nwould wreak havoc on the sales organization, not to mention the \noverall personnel budget.  \nAfter an hour, the president stood up and asked, \"Is there anyone \nhere who still believes that our strategic plan is internally consistent?\" \nNo one responded.  \nThe managers had known both halves of the contradiction: that \nnovices are less productive salespeople, and that the new sales goals \nwould require them to hire more novices.

Seaver \nbelieved that the key to success in the marketplace lay in having good \nproducts priced competitively. Henry agreed but also felt that service \nquality could play a big part in whether or not customers chose \nMeadowlands. He believed that the company should invest in \nupgrading its service through training Meadowlands dealers in \nperforming a wide range of services from better account management \nto office design and troubleshooting for all manner of problems that \nMeadowlands customers might encounter. Seaver thought these were \ngood ideas but would not support spending significantly more on \ndealer support than they were already because he was convinced that \nthey would not have significant impa ct on Meadowlands' sales. \"People \nexpect decent service in our business,\" he said. \"They will not pay \nextra for it.\"  \nSeaver appeared to have plenty of evidence on his side. For one, \nsalespeople continually returned to the home office with stories of \nhow difficult it was to make sales unless they could increase discounts. \n\"Our competitors are discounting like mad and we can only hold our \nown if we match or better them,\" was the typical refrain.

Even when Henry \nwould pursue the point more forcefully, customers would usually \nrespond, \"That sounds nice but what would really make a difference \nto us would be another 5 percent off on the big order we've been \ndiscussing with your sales reps.\" He had to admit that he was the only \none on the top team who took the service idea very seriously, and \neven he had to wonder sometimes.  \nStill, Henry held to his belief that there must be a way to gain \ncompetitive advantage through bette r service.

Seaver and Henry \nteamed up as corporate management, deciding, jointly, how much to \ninvest to help Meadowlands' local dealers build the infrastructure to \nprovide customer service. Cortland  and Jaynes became the Mead-\nowlands sales department, deciding whether and how much to dis-\ncount prices each quarter in order to  reach sales targets. As in real \nlife, these two decisions were made separately. There was, however, a \ncommon goal: the highest possible profits for the firm, over a five-year \ntime span.  \nAt the outset of the simulation, a temporary recession caused an \nearly decline in new orders. Cortland and Jaynes, hoping to maintain \nmarket share, responded by increasing the discount percentage. \nMarket share held relatively steady  but there was a decline in profit \nmargins, which meant that Seaver and Henry had to reduce their \ndealer support investment. Through their combined efforts market \nshare held steady and margins declin ed only slightly over the first year.  \nUnfortunately, the quiet was short-lived. Over the next two years, \nCortland and Jaynes found it neces sary to gradually but steadily \nincrease discounts. To compensate for the ever-declining profits, \nSeaver and Henry gave less and less support to dealers. By the end of \nthree years, price discounts had risen 25 percent and margins had fallen \n20 percent relative to the start. Although market share had been \npreserved, the team members felt little satisfaction with their business \nperformance.  \nIn the discussion that followed, Co rtland and Jaynes said that the \nsimulation confirmed their assumption that competitive pricing is \ncritical. \"As we kept going,\" said Cortland, \"it seemed to me that \ncustomers wanted even more discounts than they did at the outset. \nWhen we tried to hold discounts fi xed that last year, volume dropped \ndramatically\"\u2014far more rapidly, he said, than it had when they \nfixed discounts early in the game. Seaver said that the experiment had \ncertainly done nothing to change his mind that pricing was much more \ncritical than service; he and Henry had found that short-term boosts \nin dealer support appeared to have little impact on customer orders, \nwhile cutting dealer support had little apparent adverse affect on \ndemand.

Finally, he sug-\ngested that they try another experiment. \"Why don't we see what \nhappens if, rather than boosting di scounts, we increase dealer sup-\nport and maintain prices. We've got nothing to lose. It's only a \ngame.\" The others didn't see th e point, but they didn't see any \nreason to refuse, either.  \nAt first, their fears were realized. Customer orders fell off and \nprofits were depressed, both by the reduction in revenues and by \nincreases in dealer support. By the end of the second year, volume \nwas still down five percent and marg ins were down 12 percent. Cort-\nland and Jaynes asked if they rea lly had to stay with the \"no dis-\ncounting\" policy. Henry pointed out that orders were no longer \nfalling, and that they should be patient. In the third year, a turn-\naround began. Volume started increasing, as did margins. They kept \np l a y i n g .  B y  t h e  f i f t h  y e a r ,  v o l u m e  a n d  m a r g i n s  w e r e  b o t h  w e l l  a b o v e  \ntheir initial levels. The team members were surprised and a little \nincredulous.  \nWhen they examined more closely what had happened in the two \nsimulations, the management team discovered a reinforcing process \nbuilt into the structure of the model. The process tended to reinforce \nthe starting assumptions. In the first simulation, their lower prices led \nto lower profits, which in turn led to less investment and lower service \nquality. This produced disgruntled customers, who in turn clamored \nfor more price cuts. Late-in-the-game efforts to attract them with \nbetter service quality lacked credibility, because they had experienced \npoor service for so long. This put even further pressure on the \ncompany to lower prices, which started the cycle all over again.  \nConversely, in the second simulation, the vicious spiral became a \nvirtuous spiral. Following Bill Henry's assumption that service mat-\ntered to customers, they invested in dealer support, and service \nquality gradually improved. This made no difference in the short run \nbecause customers have to experience improved service before they \ntake it seriously. The benefits of  investing in service took several \nyears to harvest because the repurchasing delay in the shelving in-\ndustry is two to four years. That repurchase delay had never been \nseen as an important factor before.  \nYet, it turned out to be critical to seeing that both Henry and \nSeaver were right. Seaver was right when he maintained that service \ndoesn't matter as much as price.

Consequently, customers don't ex-\npect service and don't ask for it. If a manufacturer offers to provide a \nhigher standard of service, customers, understandably, respond \nskeptically. On the other hand, Henry was also right. Potentially, \naccording to the model used in the microworld, service could be a \ncompetitive weapon.6 The key lay in understanding that customers \nfirst had to experience the benefits of better service before they \nwould value service. This meant that any service-oriented strategy had \nto be a long-term strategy.  \nMoreover, the process of managing in the microworld had re-\nvealed some fascinating patterns in how the team and other Mead-\nowlands managers interacted. In the first play, before they had \nadopted Henry's alternative strategy, the two teams of decision makers \nhad quickly formed into tight units and set about making decisions in \nways that, in retrospect, seemed all too familiar at Meadowlands. \nThe corporate people (Seaver and Henry) operated in a separate \nworld from the local salespeople (Cortland and Jaynes). The two teams \nstarted strategizing and acting almost as if they were each other's \nadversaries. \"We'd be making money if it weren't for you\"; \"You \nguys are giving away the store!\" said Seaver and Henry, \nrespectively, as Cortland and Jaynes kept increasing discounts to hold \nsales volume (which of course is how Meadowlands' sales force is \nmeasured). After a brief exchange in an effort to coordinate, Cortland \nsaid, \"Let's do it the 'Meadowlan ds way'; you do it your way and \nwe'll do it ours.\" A little later, Seaver cried out, \"Leave it alone,\" as \nCortland and Jaynes prepared to raise discounts one more time.  \nAfterward, the entire group read over transcripts of the actual \nexchange, which everyone found hilarious. As they chuckled, Henry \noffered the simple explanation, \"This is why we sell shelving.\" Re-\nflecting on the transcript, the team identified several themes which \nthey felt often characterized how Meadowlands' management teams \nworked:  \n\u2022 Act as if your dimension of the system is the most important \n\u2022 Hold others responsible for negative effects of the policies as I \ndefine negative \n\u2022 Advocate your view, and do not inquire into your own or your \npartner's or other's reasoning \nThe microworld experiment at Meadowlands not only revealed an \nimportant strategic insight, but it had also begun to reveal, in a", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2468, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4452ef67-cec1-4908-9a62-8ae3ba7672b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "4452ef67-cec1-4908-9a62-8ae3ba7672b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "300", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

Escalati ng insurance costs are reaching \ncrisis proportions. Physicians are giving up their practices in many \nstates because they cannot afford malpractice insurance. The costs of \nworker's compensation and health insurance are becoming a com-\npetitive millstone to many U.S. businesses\u2014for example, comprising \nupward of 20 percent of the total wage bill of Detroit auto makers, \nas opposed to 8 percent for their Japanese counterparts. Many firms \ncan no longer afford to insure themselves against many important \nrisks\u2014such as toxic waste\u2014and are turning to forms of self-insurance. \nAs the 1980s drew to an end, a nationwide consumer backlash against \nrising automobile insurance premiums was brewing, led by a \nreferendum in California to cap premiums regardless of the impact on \ninsurance company profits.  \nFor their part, reacting to the rising tide of criticism, insurers have \nblamed everything from avaricious lawyers and outdated government \nregulations to lax public morality and the \"litigious society.\" Against \nthis array of \"external forces\" they have increased lobbying, bolstered \nlegal staffs, and cut costs. Few, however, have looked seriously at how \ntheir own practices could be contributing to the crisis. Yet, as you will \ndiscover shortly, practices held in good stead are perfectly capable of \ncausing rising costs and falling quality\u2014 without any help from \noutside forces.  \nImagine, then, that you are the manager of a claims adjusting \noffice, sitting with your partner, another claims office manager, in \nfront of a personal computer screen  displaying the status of the ' \n'claims game.''7 You're in your second day of a three-day workshop back \nat the main office. Yesterday, you shared concerns and frustrations \nwith fifteen other local managers\u2014the difficulties in keeping good \npeople (turnover rates among adjusters are typically 30 to 50 percent \nper year), the struggle to continually keep up with the workload, the \ndilemmas of improving quality while k eeping a firm rein on costs. You \nalso talked about your visions for your local office and for the \ncompany. Later in the day, you spent time learning about systems \nthinking, and you now have an intellectual grasp of the basics, and a \nsense of how it might affect your day-to-day work.

But now that \nthe crisis is over, our adjusters will be able to put in more time again \ninvestigating and negotiating claims. Quality will improve, and average \nsettlement size will come back down.\"  \nIn claims adjusting, high qualit y service, from the customers' \nviewpoint, does not merely mean higher payments on settlements. \nEven overpaid customers are often left discontented. Consider the \naftermath of a car accident. The insurance adjuster asks, \"What is the \ndamage to your car?\" The claimant says, \"$3,000.\" The adjuster says, \n\"Fine, the check will be in the mail.\" The claimant hangs up the \nphone and immediately feels a stab of regret\u2014he must have asked \nfor too little. Otherwise, wouldn't the adjuster have bargained harder? \nA \"quality case\" is one settled fairly, in which the customer is treated \npromptly and considerately.  \nBergin appears satisfied.

Service \nquality is inherently subjective and personal. It depends upon rapport \nbetween server and customer. It depends on how happy the server is \nand on whether he or she experiences the job as satisfying. It depends \non the customer's expectations being met, expectations that might be \nneither clear nor mutually apprecia ted by both server and customer.  \nBecause service quality is intangible, there is a strong tendency to \nmanage service businesses by focusing on what is most tangible: such \nas numbers of customers served, costs of providing the service, and \nrevenues generated. But focusing on what's easily measured leads to \n\"looking good without being good\"\u2014to having measurable \nperformance indicators that are acceptable yet not providing quality \nservice. Work gets done but at a steadily poorer standard of quality, by \nservers who are increasingly ov erworked, underpaid, and under-\nappreciated.  \nEntire industries are actually more  vulnerable to this drift to me-\ndiocrity than individual firms. For one firm in a competitive industry, \neroding quality will be corrected relatively quickly through loss of \ncustomers. But if there is no other place for customers to turn, the \nfeedback signal from the market may be weak or nonexistent. More-\nover, expectations adjust to past experience. After a while, customers \ngive up asking for better service. Firms set their standards by looking \nat each other. If quality erodes industry-wide, firms come to accept low \nstandards without ever questioning them.  \nOftentimes, the only way this \"trance of mediocrity\" gets broken is \nwhen a completely new firm enters the market\u2014for example, a \nforeign competitor\u2014who has not been a victim of the trance. This \nrude awakening came to many U.S. manufacturing firms in the 1970s \nand 1980s, when they suddenly disc overed their levels of quality \nwere noncompetitive in a global marketplace. U.S. service firms \nhave been sheltered from foreign comp etition, but that is starting to \nchange\u2014not through the invasion of foreign imports but through \nforeign purchase of U.S. firms.

This \ntheory is based on applying systems principles and tools like the \narchetypes to the particulars of a given business.  \nAs the workshop continues, the claims managers begin to ponder \nsome important managerial lessons. It is now clear that the backlog of \nunsettled \"pending\" claims can be extremely misleading. In particular, it \nnever tells you whether or not your capacity is adequate. If there is \nmore work to do than can be done at the current standard, servers can \nalways adjust the time they spend with each custom er. If they come \nunder pressure, they simply do the job more quickly and often more \npoorly. It is simply not possible to assess capacity separately from quality in a \nservice business. If we cannot assess qualit y reliably, we cannot assess \ncapacity reliably. This is why so many service businesses have chronic \nundercapacity.  \nTo put your new insights to a te st, you and Rosabeth experiment \nwith some further strategies. You learn that what is required is more \nthan just hiring people. When you \"throw more bodies at the prob-\nlem,\" hiring large numbers of new ad justers, it produces only modest \ngains in quality; the newcomers quickly adopt the mediocre standards \nof the rest of the office. You must develop a balanced strategy of \naggressive hires and steadily elevating quality standards. The result, \nover the long run, is steady improvement in quality and cost. \nBy the third day, most of the mana gers are learning that successful \nstrategies depend on no single factor, but upon coordination. You hire \nand train people at a steady rate, you reduce staff turnover, you let \nbacklog slip somewhat at first, an d you strengthen the quality target \nsteadily. You pay close attention to the intangibles of quality and \nadjuster effectiveness. This strate gy takes some patience, but after \nfive \"years\" of it, you're shocked by how lucrative your onscreen \nbusiness has become. Even more intere sting, it is still improving. Total \ncosts (settlement costs plus expense costs) are still falling as your \nexpanded, more experienced and skil lful adjuster fo rce continues to \nimprove quality.  \nThe claims game was not designed for forecasting; and only time will \ntell what you, and the other claims managers, are able to achieve \"back \nat the ranch.\" But the learning lab has given you some fascinating \ninsights into what might be possible. It has also shown some \ndangerous problems in conventiona l management practice, such as \nmanaging by the production measur es.

The \nmost common answer, not surprisi ngly, is \"the captain.\" Others \nsay, \"The navigator, setting the direction.\" Still others say, \"The \nhelmsman, actually controlling th e direction,\" or \"the engineer \ndown there stoking the fire, providing energy,\" or, \"the social director, \nmaking sure everybody's enrolled , involved, and communicating.\" \nWhile these are legitimate leadership roles, there is another which, in \nmany ways, eclipses them all in importance. Yet, rarely does anyone \nthink of it. \nThe neglected leadership role is the designer of the ship. No one has a \nmore sweeping influence than the designer. What good does it do for \nthe captain to say, \"Turn starboard thirty degrees,\" when the designer \nhas built a rudder that will turn only  to port, or which takes six hours \nto turn to starboard? It's fruitless to  be the leader in an organization \nthat is poorly designed. Isn't it interesting that so few managers think \nof the ship's designer when th ey think of the leader's role? \nAlthough \"leader as designer\" is neglected today, it touches a chord \nthat goes back thousands of years. To paraphrase Lao-tzu, the bad \nleader is he who the people despise. The good leader is he who the \npeople praise. The great leader is he  who the people say, \"We did it \nourselves.\" \nLao-tzu also illuminates part of the reason why design is a ne-\nglected dimension of leadership: little credit goes to the designer. The \nfunctions of design are rarely visible;  they take place behind the scenes. \nThe consequences that appear today are the result of work done long \nin the past, and work today will show its benefits far in the future. \nThose who aspire to lead out of a de sire to control, or gain fame, or \nsimply to be \"at the center of the acti on\" will find little to attract them \nto the quiet design work of leadership. Not that this type of \nleadership is without its rewards. Those who practice it find deep \nsatisfaction in empowering others an d being part of an organization \ncapable of producing results that people truly care about.

Joanne, the president of a new division that is growing rapidly, \nrecognizes a limits to growth structure that could undermine continuing \ngrowth: as the number of managers in the new division grows, the \ndiversity of management styles will increase, undermining the \ncoherence of vision and operating va lues that has made the division a \nsuccess to date. The \"limiting factor\" will be the division's capacity to \nassimilate new managers. Rather than waiting for the problem to arise \nand then dealing with it, Joanne develops a selection and self-\nassessment process that helps new managers understand the current \nvision and values and see if their own style is compatible; and she \nallocates a significant portion of her own time to working with new \nmanagers. The result is continuing growth of the division. Given our \nnormal \"leader as hero\" viewpoint, this is not leadership. There is no \ncrisis\u2014in fact, there isn't even a problem that gets solved. The \n\"problem\" of inconsistency in values and vision simply never develops; \nit wasn't \"solved,\" it was \"dissolved.\" This is the hallmark of effective \ndesign.  \nAs this story illustrates, the design work of leaders includes designing \nan organization's policies, strategies, and \"systems.\" But it goes \nbeyond that. Designing policies  and strategies that no one can \nimplement because they don't understand or agree with the thinking \nbehind them has little effect. To appreciate the new view of \"leader as \ndesigner,\" let's return to the DC-3.  \nThe critical design function, without which the DC-3 would never \nhave succeeded, involved integrating the five component technologies. For \nexample, designing the engine specifications required understanding \nthe effects of the variable pitch propellers, the wing flaps, the \nretractable landing gear, as well as the stress characteristics of the new \nmonocoque body. So, too, did the wing and body design depend on \nthe engine's thrust. The task of integrating the component \ntechnologies was more critical to the success of the DC-3 than the \ntask of designing any single component.  \nDesign is, by its nature, an integrative science because design requires \nmaking something work in practice. \"We would not consider a car well \ndesigned,\" says Herman Miller's Ed Simon, \"if it had the best \ntransmission, the best seats, and the best engine, but was terrible to \nride in and impossible to control on wet roads. The essence of design \nis seeing how the parts fit together to perform as a whole.\"  \nSo too does the crucial design work for leaders of learning organi-\nzations concern integration.

Systems \nthinking is also important early on because managers are inherently \npragmatic and need insights into \"current reality\" as well as a picture \nof the future toward which they are moving. Some understanding of \nmental models and the basics of bringing underlying assumptions \nto the surface is also important ea rly on. Introducing conceptual tools \nsuch as systems thinking in isolation from learning how to work with \nmental models, both individually and in teams, often proves \ndisappointing. Managers believe that the purpose is to figure out the \n\"system out there,\" not to discover inconsistencies in their own ways \nof thinking.  \nPersonal mastery is often one of the later disciplines to emphasize \nbecause managers are often, justifia bly, cautious in overemphasizing \npersonal growth.

But if there is resistance to \ncertain disciplines, do you push or do you hold off until you have \nbuilt up momentum in another area? \nGenerally, I would counsel against pushing. Usually it is more \neffective to look for the source of the resistance, either in perceived \nlack of relevance, fear of failure (i.e., \"I won't be competent in the \nnew discipline\"\u2014rememb er we were all schoolchildren once), or \nperceived threat to the status quo. The leaders who fare best are \nthose who continually see themselves as designers not crusaders. \nMany of the best intentioned efforts to foster new learning disciplines \nfounder because those leading the charge forget the first rule of \nlearning: people learn what they need to learn, not what someone else \nthinks they need to learn. \nIn essence, the leaders' task is designing the learning processes whereby \npeople throughout the organization  can deal productively with the \ncritical issues they face, and deve lop their mastery in the learning \ndisciplines. This is new work for most experienced managers, many of \nwhom rose to the top because of their decision-making and \nproblem-solving skills, not their sk ills in mentoring, coaching, and \nhelping others learn.

I began to see that \nthese leaders were doing something different from just \"story telling,\" \nin the sense of using stories to teach lessons or transmit bits of \nwisdom. They were relating the story\u2014the overarching explanation of \nwhy they do what they do, how their organization needs to evolve, and \nhow that evolution is part of something larger. As I reflected back \non gifted leaders whom I have known, I realized that this \"larger \nstory\" was common to them all, and conversely that many otherwise \ncompetent managers in leadership positions were not leaders of the \nsame ilk precisely because they saw no larger story.  \nThe leader's purpose story is both personal and universal. It de-\nfines her or his life's work. It enobles his efforts, yet leaves an \nabiding humility that keeps him from taking his own successes and \nfailures too seriously. It brings a unique depth of meaning to his \nvision, a larger landscape upon whic h his personal dreams and goals \nstand out as landmarks on a longer journey. But what is most impor-\ntant, this story is central to his ability to lead. It places his organization's \npurpose, its reason for being, within a context of \"where we've \ncome from and where we're headed,\" where the \"we\" goes beyond the \norganization itself to humankind mo r e  b r o a d l y .  I n  t h i s  s e n s e ,  t h e y  \nnaturally see their organization as a vehicle for bringing learning and \nchange into society. This is the power of the purpose story\u2014it \nprovides a single integrating set of ideas that gives meaning to all \naspects of the leader's work.  \nOut of this deeper story and sense of purpose or destiny, the leader \ndevelops a unique relationship to his or her own personal vision. He or \nshe becomes a steward of the vision.  \nThe best way to appreciate the \"leader as steward\" in the context of \nbuilding learning organizations is to see the way individuals committed \nto such work describe their own sense of purpose.

I \nsee organizational learning as le arning how to ac cept, embrace, \nand seek change.  \nTraditional organizations change by reacting to events. The \nreason for this, I think, is that the \"reference points\" for tradi-\ntional organizations are extern al, outside ourselves. Usually \nthese reference points are the way things were in the past. \nSometimes, they include the way our competitors operate. \nChange means giving up these reference points. So, naturally, it is \nresisted.  \nTo be vision-led means that our reference points are internal, \nthe visions of the future we will create, not what we were in the \npast or what our competitors are doing.

The starting point \nwas back in the late '70s and early '80s, when it became \nincreasingly clear that our compan y, as well as other companies in \nAmerica, were coming under heavy pressure from Japan. I \ngradually became convinced that there was a crisis looming of \nenormous magnitude, a crisis that is still, in my estimation, \nlooming, despite the progress we've made in recent years.  \nIn response to this crisis, we began to get involved with the \nvariety of improvement processes coming out of Japan. But, \nyou quickly get lost with the \"alphabet soup\" of TQC, JIT, \nQFD, and all the consultants running around with today's newest \nacronym. Drawing on the thinking of Shell's Arie de Geus \n[another participant in the MIT research program], I began to see \naccelerating organizational learning as an integrating concept for a \nbroad range of improvement tools and methods. Most \nimportantly, as I tried to illustrate in an article for Sloan Man-\nagement Review, I began to see that the rate at which organizations \nlearn may become the only sustainable source of competitive \nadvantage, especially in knowledge-intensive businesses.'

I believe our fun-\ndamental challenge is tapping the intellectual capacity of people at \nall levels, both as individuals and as groups. To truly engage \neveryone\u2014that's the untapped potential in modern corpora-\ntions. This leads me to the notion of an organization as a learning \norganism.  \nThat is easy to say, but I believe there are significan t insights that \nwill be required to make it real. One of the questions that interests \nme deeply is, \"What are the rules of the cognitive processes by \nwhich valid learning takes place?\" I believe we can use the term \norganizational learning very loosely and it will end up having little \nmeaning. It will become just another fad. PMS: How do you \ndistinguish between valid learning and specious  \nlearning?  \nSTATA : One of the fundamentals is that valid learning does not \noccur unless you continuously go ba ck to reality. All knowledge is \nobjective in the sense that ther e must be some correspondence \nto reality. That seems fairly obvious, but, as Ayn Rand observed, \nmankind tends to drift toward the primacy of consciousness and \nto the supremacy of thought, and it's only by discipline that you \nactually come to accept reality as a judge.  \nIn response to this, the \"pragmatists\" of modern philosophy \ntake the view that there is no point in worrying about general \ntheory. You should do what works, and whatever works today \nmay not work tomorrow. This view is strongly reinforced in \ncontemporary management with its emphasis on solving prob-\nlems. It's so easy to just go from one problem to the next, \"from \npillar to post,\" without ever seei ng a larger pattern. Pragmatism \ndenies any ability of the human mind to synthesize, to see a \nbigger picture.  \nPragmatism has become domina nt, in part, because of the \nprevious dominance of elaborate theoretical systems that had no \nreal correspondence to reality. The nineteenth century was a great \ntime for this; and the obvious failure of these great systems of \nthought like Marx's world system has been one of the justifications \nfor pragmatism.  \nInterestingly, just as local workers have gotten stuck as the \n\"doers\" in traditional organiza tions, managers have gotten", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2451, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb4be1c3-5389-4302-af6f-6413d21f438f": {"__data__": {"id_": "fb4be1c3-5389-4302-af6f-6413d21f438f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "326", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

You are \"its\" as much as it is yours. \nGeorge Bernard Shaw expressed the relationship succinctly when he \nsaid: \nThis is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized \nb y  y o u r s e l f  a s  a  m i g h t y  o n e  ... t h e  b e i n g  a  f o r c e  o f  n a t u r e  i n s t e a d  o f  \na feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining \nthat the world will not devote itself to making you happy.3 \nSlightly different in tone and focus, but no less evocative, is the \ncharacterization of Lebanese poet Kahlil Gibran, who, in speaking of \nparents and children, captured the special sense of responsibility without \npossessiveness felt by leaders toward their vision:  \nYour children are not your children.  \nThey are the sons and daughters of life's longing for itself.  \nThey come through you, not from you.  \nAnd though they are with you, they belong not to you.  \nYou may give them your love but not your thoughts,  \nFor they have their own thoughts.  \nYou may house their bodies but not their souls,  \nFor their souls dwell in the hous e of tomorrow, which you cannot  \nvisit, not even in your dreams. You may strive to be like them, but strive \nnot to make them like  \nyou. \nFor life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday. You are the bows from \nwhich your children as living arrows are  \nsent forth. The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and \nhe \nbends you with his might that the arrows may go swift and  \nfar. \nLet your bending in the archer's hand be  for gladness; For even as he loves the \narrow that flies, so he loves the bow that  \nis stable.*", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2252, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "70023d02-fd17-4c9a-af8c-f443f39d832a": {"__data__": {"id_": "70023d02-fd17-4c9a-af8c-f443f39d832a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "328", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

Given such ways of defining \nreality, vision is an idle dream at best and a cynical delusion at worst \u2014\nbut not an achievable end. By cont rast, for painters, composers, or \nsculptors, creating involves working within constraints\u2014for example, \nthe constraints imposed by their media. If one had but to snap one's \nfingers and the vision became real ity, there would be no creative \nprocess. How, then, do leaders help people achieve a view of reality, \nsuch as the artist's, as a medium fo r creating rather than as a source \nof limitation? This is the task  of the \"leader as teacher.\"  \nBuilding on the hierarchy of explanation first introduced in Chapter \n3, leaders can influence people to vi ew reality at four distinct levels: \nevents, patterns of behavior, syst emic structures, and a \"purpose \nstory.\" The key question becomes where predominantly do they focus their \nand their organization's attention?  \nBy and large, leaders of our curren t institutions focus their attention \non events and patterns of behavior\u2014and, under their influence, their \norganizations do likewise. That is why contemporary organizations are \npredominantly reactive, or at best responsive\u2014rarely generative.  \nOn the other hand, leaders in learning organizations pay attention \nto all four levels, but focus pred ominantly on purpose and systemic \nstructure. Moreover, they \"teach\" people throughout the organization \nto do likewise.  \nSystemic structure is the domain of systems thinking and mental \nmodels. At this level, leaders are co ntinually helping people see the big \npicture: how different parts of the organization interact, how different \nsituations parallel one another because of common underlying \nstructures, how local actions have  longer-term and broader impacts \nthan local actors often realize, and why certain operating policies are \nneeded for the system as a whole.

They collude in thei r and their organization's desire to \nassuage uneasiness and avoid uncertain ty by pretending everything is \ngoing fine. They become speech make rs rather than leaders. They \nbecome \"true believers\" rather than learners. \nCREATIVE   TENSION \nLeaders who are designers, stewards, and teachers come to see their \ncore task very simply. \"Just as Socr ates felt that it was necessary to \ncreate a tension in the mind,\" said Martin Luther King, Jr., \"so that \nindividuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half truths . . . so \nmust we . . .  create the kind of tension in society that will help men \nrise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism.\"8 The tension of \nwhich King spoke is the creative tension of personal mastery. This tension \nis generated by holding a vision and concurrently telling the truth about \ncurrent reality relative to that vision\u2014\"to dramatize the issue so that it \ncan no longer be ignored,\" as King put it. \nThe leader's creative tension is no t anxiety: that is psychological \ntension. A leader's story, sense of purpose, values and vision establish \nthe direction and target. His relentless commitment to the truth and to \ninquiry into the forces underlying current reality continually highlight \nthe gaps between reality and the vi sion. Leaders generate and manage \nthis creative tension\u2014not just in themselves but in an entire \norganization. This is how they energize an organization. That is their \nbasic job. That is  why they exist. \nMastering creative tension througho ut an organization leads to a \nprofoundly different view of reality.  People literally start to see more \nand more aspects of reality as something they, collectively, can influence. \nThis is no hollow \"belief,\" which pe ople say in an effort to convince \nthemselves that they are powerful. It  is a quiet realization, rooted in \nunderstanding that all aspects of current reality\u2014the events, the \npatterns of change, and even the systemic structures themselves\u2014are \nsubject to being influenced through creative tension. This shift of \nview, or metanoia, was expressed beautifully by the Hebrew \nexistentialist philosopher Martin Buber:9 \nOur thinking of today has estab lished a more tenacious and op-\npressive belief in fate than has ev er before existed.

Try an experiment. Say, \"I want.\" \nNow, say, \"I choose.\" What is the difference? For most people, \"I \nwant\" is passive; \"I choose\" is active. For most, wanting is a state of \nd e f i c i e n c y \u2014 w e  w a n t  w h a t  w e  d o  n o t  h a v e .

For most of us, as we \nlook back over our life, we can see that certain choices we made played \na pivotal role in how our life develo ped. So, too, will the choices we \nmake in the future be pivotal. \nThe choice to be part of a learning organization is no different. \nWhether it is an \"organization\" of three or three thousand matters \nnot. Only through choice does an individual come to be the steward of \na larger vision. Only through choi ce does an individual come to \npractice the learning disc iplines. Being in a supportive environment can \nhelp, but it does not obviate the need for choice. Learning orga-\nnizations can be built only by individuals who put their life spirit into \nthe task. It is our choices  that focus that spirit. \nIt is not the purpose of this book to convince people that they \nshould choose to build learning organizations. Rather, I have tried to \npaint the picture of what such an organization would be like and how it \nmight be built\u2014so that people ca n see the choice that exists.

Human systems are \ninfinitely complex. \"You can never figure it out,\" I suggested\u2014 \nbecause it's \"un-figure-out-able.\" Nonetheless, we can enhance our \nmastery of complexity.  \nEvidence is overwhelming that human beings have \"cognitive lim-\nitations.\" Cognitive scientists have shown that we can deal only with a \nvery small number of separate variables simultaneously. Our conscious \ninformation processing circuits get easily overloaded by detail \ncomplexity, forcing us to invoke simplifying heuristics to figure \nthings out.  \nBut then how can we explain driving an automobile at sixty miles per \nhour in heavy traffic\u2014or playing tennis, or playing a Mozart sonata? \nAll of these tasks are enormously complex, involving hundreds of \nvariables and rapid changes that must be recognized and responded to \nimmediately. Moreover, to the extent  that we are masterful in these \ntasks, they are accomplished with little or no \"conscious attention.\" \nWe drive through traffic while carrying on a conversation with the \nperson next to us.

Cultures program the subconscious. If you grow up in a \nsociety that discriminates sharply be tween certain races or castes, you \nwill literally see and interact with people differently from the way you \nwill if you grow up in a culture that is less race or caste-conscious. \nBeliefs also program the subconscious. It is well established, for \nexample, that beliefs affect perception: if you believe that people are \nuntrustworthy, you will continually \"see\" double-dealing and chicanery \nthat others without this belief would not see.  \nPerhaps most subtly, language programs the subconscious. The \neffects of language are especially subtle because language appears not \nso much to affect the content of the subconscious but the way the \nsubconscious organizes and structures the content it holds. If this is \ntrue, how, then, have we been teaching the subconscious to organize \ninformation?  \nAs shown in Chapter 5, it is extremely awkward in normal verbal \nlanguage to describe circular feedba ck processes. So, by and large, we \ngive up and just say, in effect, \"A caused B, which caused C.\" But this \nconvenient shorthand suggests to the subconscious mind that \"A did \ncause B.\" Subconsciously, we tend to forget that \"B also caused A.\" \nIf all we have is linear language, th en we think in linear ways, and we \nperceive the world linearly\u2014that is, as a chain of events. It is \nimpossible for us to grasp the scope of the consequences, but we \nknow they are sweeping.  \nHowever, if we begin to master a systemic language, all this starts to \nchange. The subconscious is subtly retrained to structure data in \ncircles instead of straight lines. We find that we \"see\" feedback \nprocesses and systems archetypes everywhere. A new framework for \nthinking becomes embedded. A switch is thrown, much like what \nhappens in mastering a foreign language. We begin to dream in the new \nlanguage, or to think spontaneously in its terms and constructs. When \nthis happens with systems thinking, we become, as one manager puts \nit, \"looped for life.\"  \nAs organizational theorist Charles Kiefer puts it, \"When this \nswitch is thrown subconsciously, you become a systems thinker ever \nthereafter. Reality is automatically seen systemically as well as linearly \n(there still are lots of problems for which a linear perspective is \nperfectly adequate). Alternatives that are impossible to see linearly are \nsurfaced by the subconscious as proposed solutions. Solutions that \nwere outside of our 'feasible set' become part of our feasible set. \n'Systemic' becomes a way of thinking (almost a way of being) and \nnot just a problem solving methodology.\"", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2732, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9dec13ce-b64f-4f8d-b26a-d7ac7e839046": {"__data__": {"id_": "9dec13ce-b64f-4f8d-b26a-d7ac7e839046", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "342", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

Just as it deals with far more details than our \nconscious mind, it can also deal with far more intricate dynamic \ncomplexity. Significantly, as it a ssimilates hundreds of feedback re-\nlationships simultaneously, it integrates detail and dynamic complexity \ntogether.  \nThis is why practice is so important. For any meaningful interplay of \nconscious and subconscious, practice is essential. Conceptual learning \nis not enough, any more than it would be for learning a foreign \nlanguage or for learning to ride a bicycle. In this context, tools like \nmicroworlds come into their own\u2014as cultural media, as places to \npractice thinking and acting systemically.  \nThe value of systems thinking also goes beyond that derived by any \ninstitution. To explain, let me take a step back.  \nThere is a certain irony to mankind's present situation, viewed \nfrom an evolutionary perspective. The human being is exquisitely \nadapted to recognize and respond to threats to survival that come in \nthe form of sudden, dramatic events. Clap your hands and people \njump, calling forth some genetically encoded memory of saber-\ntoothed tigers springing from the bush.  \nYet today the primary threats to our collective survival are slow, \ngradual developments arising from processes that are complex both in \ndetail and in dynamics. The spread of nuclear arms is not an event, nor \nis the \"greenhouse effect,\" the depletion of the ozone layer, \nmalnutrition and underdevelopment in the Third World, the eco-\nnomic cycles that determine our quality of life, and most of the other \nlarge-scale problems in our world.  \nLearning organizations themselves may be a form of leverage on the \ncomplex system of human endeavors. Building learning organizations \ninvolves developing people who learn to see as systems thinkers see, \nwho develop their own personal mastery, and who learn how to \nsurface and restructure mental mo dels, collaboratively. Given the \ninfluence of organizations in today's world, this may be one of the \nmost powerful steps toward helping us \"rewrite the code,\" altering \nnot just what we think but our predominant ways of thinking.

In a heated debate, the novice at working \nwith mental models will have to make an effort to identify the \nassumptions he is making and why. Often the beginner's efforts \nin a discipline are characterized by time displacement: only after \nthe debate, does one see one's assumptions clearly and \ndistinguish them from the \"data\"  and reasoning upon which they \nare based. However, eventually, the practices of a discipline \nbecome more and more automatic and active in \"real time.\" You \nfind yourself spontaneously thinking of systems archetypes, re-\ncreating (which is different fr om recalling) your vision, and \nrecognizing your assumptions as they come into play, while \nconfronting pressing problems. \nEqually central to any discipline are the underlying principles. \nThese represent the theory that lies behind the practices of the \ndisciplines. For example, \"structure influences behavior\" is a \ncentral principle underlying systems thinking, as is \"policy \nresistance,\" the tendency of complex systems to resist efforts to \nchange their behavior. The former  implies that the ability to \ninfluence reality comes from seeing structures that are controlling \nbehavior and events. The latter imp lies that efforts to manipulate \nbehavior, for example through well-intentioned programs such as \nbuilding new houses for disadvantaged urban dwellers, will \ngenerally improve matters only in the short run and often lead to \nstill more problems in the long run. Similarly, the power of vision \nis a p rinciple of pe rsonal maste ry , as is the distinction  between \n\"creative tension\" and \"emotional tension.\" \nThe principles behind a discipline are important to the beginner \nas well as to the master. For the beginner, they help him in \nunderstanding the rationale behind the discipline and in making \nsense of the practices of the discipline. For the master, they are \npoints of reference which aid in continually refining the practice \nof the discipline and in explaining it to others. \nIt is important to reco gnize that mastering any of the disciplines \nrequires effort on both the levels of understanding the principles \nand following the practices. It is tempting to think that just \nbecause one understands certain principles one has \"learned\" \nabout the discipline. This is the familiar trap of confusing \nintellectual understanding with learning. Learning always involves \nnew understandings and new behaviors, \"thinking\" and \n\"doing.\" This is the reason for distinguishing principles from \npractices. Both are vital. \nThe third level, the \"essences\" of the disciplines, is different. \nThere is no point in focusing one's conscious attention and \neffort on these essences in learning a discipline, any more than it \nwould make sense to make an effort to experience love or joy or \ntranquillity. The essences of the disciplines are the state of being \nthat comes to be experienced naturally by individuals or groups \nwith high levels of mastery in the disciplines.

This is why we refer to them as personal \ndisciplines, even those that must  be practiced collaboratevely.  \nFor example, systems thinking lead s to experiencing more and more of the \ninterconnectedness of life and to seeing wholes rather than parts. Whenever \nthere are problems, in a family or in an organization, a master of systems \nthinking automatically sees them as aris ing from underlying structures rather \nthan from individual mistakes or ill wi ll. Likewise, personal mastery leads to \nan increased sense of \"beingness,\" awareness of the present moment, both \nwhat is happening within us and outside of us, and to heightened experience \nof \"generativeness,\" of being part of the creative forces shaping one's life.  \nAt the level of essences, the disciplines start to converge. There is a \ncommon sensibility uniting the disciplines\u2014the sensibility of being learners in \nan intrinsically interdependent world. Yet, there are still differences between \nthe disciplines. But the differences become increasingly subtle. For example, \n\"interconnectedness\" (systems thin king) and \"connectedness\" (personal \nmastery) are subtle distinctions. The fo rmer has to do with awareness of how \nthings interrelate to one another; the latter with awareness of being part of \nrather than apart from the world. So, too, is the distinction between \n\"commonality of purpose\" (shared visi on) and \"alignment\" (team learning) a \nfine one. While the former has to do with a common direction and reason \nfor being, the latter has to do with \"functioning as a whole\" when we \nactually work together. Though subtle, th ese distinctions are important. Just as \nthe connoisseur of fine wines makes distinctions that the novice would not, \nso do individuals and groups who develop high levels of mastery in the \ndisciplines see distinctions that might be obscure to beginners.  \nLastly, the disciplines of building shar ed vision and team  learning differ \nfrom the other three in that they are inherently collective in nature. The \npractices are activities engaged in by groups. The principles must be under-\nstood by groups.

As this \ncorrection is used more and more, more fundamental long-term \ncorrective measures are used less and less.

What do you mean, there's trouble down that road?\" \nManagement Principle: Focus on the fundamental solution. If \nsymptomatic solution is impera tive (because of delays in \nfundamental solution), use it to gain time while working on the \nfundamental solution. \nBusiness Story: A dramatic new circuit board technology can be \nused to develop unique functionality and cost savings in a great \nmany new product applications, but it can also be substituted for \nexisting boards in current products. Salespeople can try to sell to \n\"specialty customers\" who appreciate the special properties of the \ntechnology and will eventually design new products which exploit \nit fully (the \"fundamental solution\") or sell to \"commodity \ncustomers\" who do not care about its special properties and will \nsimply substitute it for other boards (the \"symptomatic \nsolution\"). Given management pressures to meet quarterly sales \ntargets, salespeople sell to whoever is ready to buy, which usually \nwill be commodity customers sinc e there are more of them and \ndelays in the selling cycle are shorter. Over time, the dramatic \nnew technology fails to develop a loyal customer base and \nbecomes subject to the price and margin pressures that \ncharacterize commodity products. \nOther Examples: Selling more to existing  customers rather than \nbroadening the customer base (The \"ATP case\" from Chapter \n12); paying bills by borrowing, instead of going through the \ndiscipline of budgeting; using alcohol, drugs, or even something \nas benign as exercise to relieve work stress and thereby not \nfacing the need to control the wo rkload itself; and any addiction, \nanywhere, to anything.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2140, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9cf6f84-7e83-4334-a494-5200b913211e": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9cf6f84-7e83-4334-a494-5200b913211e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "357", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

The intervention \nattempts to ameliorate obvious problem symptoms, and does so \nso successfully that the people within the system never learn how \nto deal with the problems themselves. \nManagement Principle: \"Teach people to fish, rather than giving \nthem fish.\" Focus on enhancing the capabilities of the \"host \nsystem\" to solve its own problems.  If outside help is needed, \n\"helpers\" should be strictly limited to a one-time intervention \n(and everyone knows this in advance) or be able to help people \ndevelop their own skills, resources, and infrastructure to be \nmore capable in the future. \nBusiness Story: An innovative insurance company was \ncommitted to the concept of independent local offices that \nwould call on headquarters staff only for occasional help. Initially \nthe concept worked well, until the industry went through a crisis. \nFacing sudden severe losses, the local offices called in the more \nexperienced central management for help in rewriting rate \nstructures\u2014a process which took months. Meanwhile, the local \nmanagers focused their attention on managing the crisis. The \ncrisis was resolved, but the next time rate structures were called \ninto question, the local offices had lost some of their confidence. \nThey called in the central managers as \"insurance.\" After several \nyears of this behavior, the local offices found themselves without \nunderwriters who could manage rate structure changes \nindependently. \nSPECIAL CASE: SHIFTING THE \nBURDEN TO THE INTERVENOR\nStructure:", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1702, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff1354d1-750c-45af-b80c-7540db9ffdcc": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff1354d1-750c-45af-b80c-7540db9ffdcc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "358", "file_name": "1 - Peter M.

Or, you could eliminate the middlemen entirely \nand have \nbreweries supply retailers directly. Redesigning the physical \nsystem \n(physical flows of goods, people, and materials; information; \nrewards \nand other factors outside the individual decision makers' \nimmediate \ncontrol) is an important leadership function in real life. But \nsuccess \ndepends on leaders' systemic understanding, just as changing \nindividual \nways of placing orders depends on systemic \nunderstanding.

The heart of \nAristotle's \ndefinition of polis is retained in our current use of the phrase \n\"a circle \nof friends,\" which represents a \"finite group of people \nunited by ac \nquaintance, common sentiments, and interests\u2014in short an \nassocia \ntion.\" From Terence Dall, Political Theory and Praxis \n(Minneapolis: \nUniversity of Minnesota Press), 1977. \n2.
